1,"Okay, House Budget Committee will come back to order. Mr. Luebbering, if you would continue, thanks for joining us once again. Patrick Luebbering and Kim Evans did have to leave. She unfortunately had to attend a funeral tomorrow in Kennett, so she needed to get on the road for that. All right, so we left off on page 409. This was one-time funding added in 25. It's zeroed out, and it is for Matty Road Center for a project that uses a holistic approach to individual and family well-being through services and behavioral health counseling. Next one is page 415. This again is a one-time program funded in FY25. It was not funded in 24, but it was previously funded in FY23. This is for a Better Family Life program that seeks to provide exposure to foreign arts, creative development, film, media industry, and customer service fields, and it is zeroed out again for this year. Representative Murray, you have an inquiry. You may proceed. Yeah. Thank you, Mr.",FALSE,,
2,"Chair. In regards to Better Family Life, I'm curious, similarly along the same lines of how you spoke to why this one is zeroed out, I see in FY23 and then there is a gap in FY24. Can you speak to why there is a gap in terms of the funding? Yeah. So, typically, these are, many of these items are ones added by the General Assembly as a one-time, so what happens is they are automatically cut during the partner request, and then basically in the past, it's kind of been sort of, if the General Assembly wants to fund it again, then they can choose to fund it and make that decision, so it kind of leaves the decision making authority back in your hands each year. Okay. And, you know, if they want it ongoing, then, you know, they'll put it in as ongoing, but otherwise, you know, we respect what they put in as a one-time, and we'll leave that decision up to them the next year. Okay.",FALSE,,
3,"That's fair. I just know, like, with the Better Family Life, they just provide, you know, so many resources in terms of job training for, and support services for almost, like, 2,000 individuals annually. Yeah.",FALSE,,
4,"And I believe, if I'm correct, we have other... Carry on. We do. We have other... We'll get to that. Okay. We have other contracts with Better Family Life, too. Okay. This is just one program, so this is not all of our funding. Okay. We can get that for you, if you'd like, because all funding we give to Better, or the state funds. That's fair. And I would assume this one is more in regards to the exposure, like, to performing arts or creative development. Yeah. It's a specific program within Better Family Life. Okay. I'll take a look at it in the program book. Thank you. Mm-hmm. All right. That is it for book number two. We will move on to book three of eight. First page is on page 421. This is ongoing funding for Annie Malone for the Economic Mobility Program. It offers a comprehensive initiative empowering youth and families through viable employment, support, and personal growth, including behavioral health and substance abuse services. It is $2 million of TANF for FY26. All right. Next section is page 427. This was a one-time in FY25, zeroed out for FY26. This is for The Village. It's a nonprofit organization in St. Louis metropolitan community that provides real life experience, safe spaces to explore healthy peer-to-peer relationships, and the cultivation of strong and sustainable work ethic. Next page is page 433, Powerhouse in Columbia. This is ongoing funding of $500,000 TANF. This is for a healthy marriage and fatherhood initiative program that connecting fathers to resources to help provide financial assistance. When they say financial assistance, that's the child support payment. Enabling them through different services to help connect them with their child and connect them with services that enables them to help meet their child support obligations. Representative Lewis, do you have an inquiry? You may proceed.",FALSE,,
5,"Thank you. This is actually kind of a global question for some of these items, like the healthy marriage and fatherhood. There's several of these really good programs that are out there. It's $2.5 million as allocated. I'm all for it. How is that going to get out the door? Is it going to go through a community partnership to get to the final recipient, or is it going to be directly allocated from the Department of Social Services? This one we allocate out directly to the Powerhouse. We have an existing contract with them. I believe this is the one we do have a contract directly with the Powerhouse community development on this. This one doesn't run through, but several other ones do run through community partnerships. This one, the healthy marriage and fatherhood one, that was the one I was actually thinking I was talking about. We do have, and that's later on in the book, the $2.5 million. That one is bid out by region. I just know when I was looking back through these, one of them was the fatherhood one. That one went through a community partnership to be allocated. When it goes through the community partnership, then they take a percentage instead of you giving it directly to them? On those, when we're working through the community partnerships, they do get a percentage for the administration that normally on some of these programs for compliance, for helping them set up the budget for oversight that we pass on to the community partnerships. They're basically doing tasks that we would normally have to do or taking on responsibilities we normally would. Would you be able to do it more efficiently? Without knowing what they do, I don't know. If we take that burden on, we are going to have to have some additional resources to do the monitoring. On a lot of these programs, a lot of these smaller entities have never had federal funds before. There's a lot of strings. There's a lot of- When there's some that are larger, like a $7 million ongoing appropriation that we've done for the last five years, that's $700,000 a year. Those type of things require almost no- We'd still have to do the compliance piece because we are required to compliance them and do the auditing piece. On some of those, yeah, it would be easier. We would need the authority within statute. You'd need a bill that says you have the right to do that, the ability to do that? Yeah, along with additional staff and compliance resources and monitoring. Somebody's got to do the work right now. Community Partnerships is doing that work. Without using them, we would have to do that work. I won't belabor that point tonight because you know I'm going to ask about that multiple times so I won't. I've just asked once and I won't beat that dead horse until a future date. Okay, I appreciate that. We've had conversations. Because I'm looking at 10.30. That's when I've got for time getting out here. I understand your point. All right, the next section, this is on page 439, the Healthy Fatherhood Program. This is $2.5 million. This goes back to Senate Bill 24 that was passed in FY17 regarding the TANF program that a certain amount of the TANF funds be set aside for a fatherhood program. These are bid out by region and competitively bid. Next page is page 445. This is Adult Supplementation Grant. This is a set grant amount. This was started in 1973. It can only go down when there were some changes back then, individuals due to the Social Security change order that were placed in this new program. There can be no new members in the Adult Supplementation. They were all fathered in. Some of them were children. Eventually this program will go away. There's only one way out of the program. All right, next is Cabralo, I believe it is. You have an inquiry, you may proceed. Thank you, Mr.",FALSE,,
6,"Chair. When you said that, so there's only so many in there, then why do we have any, and this is just me thinking, I'm sure it doesn't fit government thinking probably, but if we have $10,000, why don't we spread it out amongst those that are there instead of having $3,060 unexpended? So they got a set amount, so it was like a hold harmless, so when they moved from the Social Security, and that was way before my time in 73, but basically they were receiving assistance that basically changed. So all these were grandfathered in at a certain amount. Thank you. All right, next section is on page 450, the Life Unlimited Housing. This is a one-time for FY25. For $5 million it is zeroed out. This is funding to the Life Unlimited Housing Projects, we did have a misspelling on that on page 450, for the construction of a building to serve individuals with intellectual and development disabilities. So that is one time, I believe it was GR for last year to construct that building. Next section is page 455, this is Supplemental Nursing Care Program. So these are Medicaid-eligible individuals placed in supplementalnursing care facilities so not the nursing homes what the idealist program is is to keep them at a lower level so they're not in a more expensive nursing home care they receive there's a they receive around $390 a month for certain facilities if it's a assisted living facility an RCF to a residential care facility it's $292 and a residential care one RCF one is $156 in addition these people get a $50 stipend for personal needs monthly it does not receive Medicaid because it's not a Medicaid eligibility placement but overall the state saves money by having them in this lower costed assisted living facility and that is 25.4 million GR this had been you look on to 456 you know the past three years it's been decreasing a little bit now you look at your year-to-date expenditures you're at about 12 million and so maybe you're actually gonna get closer to that 24 or 25 million dollar appropriation Authority level for fiscal 2025 you keep on that pace but just curious is the trend there what it would suggest looking to the past three years or is that just a bit of anomaly that I think it goes hand-in-hand with the nursing home census I think some of this fell during COVID and we had some you know just my opinion this program over the last 15-20 years has kind of been fairly stable it goes up a couple million it goes down a couple million but you're right right now the trend is it's it's a little bit lower than it has been in the past. Very good, thank you. And also if there's a closing of nursing homes it could have an impact in this section too as people move out of there they'll move into here so or vice versa. And there's nothing here that we can use as far as you know matching towards drawing any federal dollars or is this a MOE situation or help with that? There is a program we've been looking at that was proposed last year there was a some transfer money in the budget between here and Medicaid that is certain of these services could be deemed Medicaid eligible in there that you may be able to lower this amount but then have them bill us for certain Medicaid allowable services because the placement itself is not Medicaid but services provide them could be Medicaid eligible. Yeah we there was a bill I don't know if you remember this Pat I think I might even carry it that we passed a couple years ago and I feel like it was because the rate was statutorily set and it kind of took that off and it made it subject to appropriation I feel like this is the section the idea was that maybe some there could be some federal as well but anyway not yet I guess is the answer if ever. So we do just a kind of tie this all in we do capitalize on what we can in Medicaid there may be more but a lot of the any of the Medicaid funded services flow through 10.810 in home and community-based services and health and senior services so the state plan personal care program is allowed to be billed in an RCF or an ALF and so anything any of the personal care tasks that an individual is eligible for in the RCF that RCF can bill Medicaid for. All right next section is on page 461 this is a blind pension grant this is funded by three cents on each $100 valuation on taxable property this is passed on to the blind pension or the blind population or service visually impaired they receive a monthly grant the current monthly grant is around $789 and we do have a rate increase for this. Representative Young you have an inquiry you may proceed.",FALSE,,
7,"Yes thank you Mr. Chair. Quick question how many blind pension recipients do we have in the state? Right now there's around 3,259 that are receiving the pension or that was as of 2024. Okay thank you. And that is 40.5 million and it comes from the blind pension fund. The next section is on page 467 and that is for a rate increase of three million two hundred and sixty seven thousand dollars blind pension this would be fund an eighty nine dollar rate increase and take the rate up to eight hundred and twenty eight dollars right I'm sorry it goes from 828 to 917 so the current grant was 828 that was a previous year's grant so look at the wrong year and 24 was 79 89 and 25 is 828 and this would take it up to 917 this is required that we request this per statute it is based on the growth in the fund roughly 75% of the growth in the fund goes towards a rate increase previously it was mandated that we give this there was some adjustment to the statute a few years back along with some of the visual requirements to be in the program because there were some abuse that we're refining out and so this changes that we have to request it but you do not have to fund it anymore forget the funding or not I mean the you lapsed over seven million dollars last year could the could the rate increase not be absorbed in the core that we just looked at or it so it could be but we have to request it in a new decision item so if we don't grant this increase then you're not going to pay the increase even if the corporation Authority would allow it correct because during the lawsuit which was around ten years and I was part of there was some the courts looked at the budget books all the way back to 1992 to determine the intent of the General Assembly so we've been always very careful since that time to put the rate increase as a new decision item so the intent of the General Assembly can be easily ascertained now if you were looking at the core and but you're right I mean there's enough dollars there and stuff to absorb that rate Thank You representative a hue you have an inquiry you may proceed well I thought mr. chair that you would ask the question but now think I'm confused so we statutorily required to raise at a particular rate we are statutorily required to request it to request it yes okay the lapse more than accounts for any raise that would be required because of that right but because we're statutorily required to request it we've got the NDI correct okay so we don't need the NDI in plain language we would need the NDI to show that you approve the rate increase I understand that part of it but when the real when the rubber meets the road we don't need that increase that NDI increase there's yeah there's sufficient dollars there that would support that increase correct I like the way you said that yeah but I and in we had a long lawsuit and I'm a little bit have a little bit I understand yes and a very and not very but tangentially familiar with what you're talking about because basically not to belabor the point but I think that was their point is oh well you had dollars in your core you could have just went ahead and did that without the General Assembly's consent we said no and so we spent many years arguing over 15 years worth of budget books I understand thank you mr. chair if there was language such that define the rate that could be intent could it not I would have to talk to the lawyers oh okay I mean I do not want to get in trouble with this one again yeah sure well we don't want to run afoul the law you know but I'd say if we write the law as such that prescribes a particular rate and if the authority could support a particular rate I mean if that ain't intent I don't know what is but anyhow I realize I'm not a lawyer and the common-sense side of me would agree with you on that sure yeah well you're not a lawyer either no that's a feature not a bug perhaps so representative Mayhew does not he had his inquiry we'll go to representative Chapel now if he still has inquiry it's getting late yes sir yeah go ahead representative Chapel thank you mr. chair it is getting late I don't mean to prolong the issue you can't increase the rate unless the NDI is approved I'm not trying to trip you up I'm really not I'm so I would say based on the lawsuit we have taken the approach to always ask for a new decision item because if so say we didn't ask for the NDI and we gave a rate increase this year next year we don't ask for an NDI and we don't give a rate increase so first of all we have to ask for the NDI per the statute but if we do it with or without your permission that would set a different precedent I think by law but again I'm not a lawyer so what if we granted the NDI but for just for the sake of argument a dollar as long as it was clear what the rateincrease in the NDI I think was fine. Or you could go back and just cut the core if that's what you want. And it would still have the same impact. So if we cut the core by this amount and then increase the NDI and approve the NDI, then we would be able to get it done? Okay.",FALSE,,
8,Yeah.,FALSE,,
9,"All right. And again, with all the legal stuff that's went on with this, I hate to give a definitive answer. Well the one thing I know about attorneys, absolutely so, is that half of them are wrong every day. Because one wins and one loses. So you know, I don't want to run afoul of the law either, but that makes some sense to cut the core and then approve the NDI. Maybe.",FALSE,,
10,"All right, sir. Thank you. Okay. Anybody else want to try this one? All right. Very good. You may continue. Thank you. Thank you. Next is the Blind Administration. It's for 5.8 million dollars, a hundred and two FTE, and 1.2 million dollars general revenue. So this is our vocational rehabilitation services for the blind. They work for individuals with, that are visually impaired, to help them obtain jobs, obtain employment, and to also, they also do some independent living skills with individuals that are visually impaired. So on the, this is the staff and the administration portion. On the next page is, or on the page 478, these are the program dollars so that we have to purchase things, provide them with actual outside training. This is the service of visually impaired money that goes along with that. It's 8.4 million total and 1.5 million GR. Representative Mayhew, you have an inquiry, you may proceed. Thank you, Mr.",FALSE,,
11,"Chair. Okay, so when I look at the history on this thing, we got quite a bit of lapse on it, and I don't know if that's necessarily good or bad, but we use this to buy equipment and provide therapies for folks that are visually impaired, correct? Correct. And so, but we're running it roughly eight and a half million, but we're, we're lapsing three and a half million dollars, so as, and I understand the biggest part of this comes from the, from the federal line on it, but it looks to me like, when we go look in 24, that we were consuming the general revenue at a higher rate than the, in the lapse category, higher than the, than the federal line, so it looks like we were spending GR when we might have had an opportunity to spend federal dollars instead. So is there several items within that that's not evident from the, from the pages that would require us to use that general revenue first? So how does that work?",FALSE,,
12,"Yeah, so there's a couple different programs in there. One's prevention of blindness, so the glaucoma string and things like that they do, that's a hundred percent GR. The VOC rehab grant is around a 80% federal match, so to a certain degree we've got to spend the overall GR to earn the federal. There's also some MOE requirements with that VOC rehab grant that we're required to meet, however much we spent, I think it's like two years ago. So there's several different things going on in that section. I think, is Keith back there? This is where we run the SSA, Social Security money through too, right? That's money we get back from the Fed that we can use 100% federal. And there are some 100% federal components in there too, through the Social Security Administration. So where there wasn't an opportunity to draw down those, those federal dollars because we weren't, that folks weren't accessing that particular thing, which depends on what services they were accessing, yeah. So on the glaucoma screening, so apparently we did a bunch of those last fiscal year, because between 23 and 24 that the general revenue lapse went from $253,000 to $16,000, so would that be an example of what what you're talking about there? Yeah, and it also goes back to the MOE, so we have to spend so much state share every year. So if you look at where it was two years ago in 22, it was closer to that amount, so and that falls over a federal fiscal year. So our claiming and matching doesn't always match up perfectly with the state fiscal year. But the federal line stayed generally the same all the way through? Yeah, because you have to spend X amount of GR for the MOE portion of the Voc Rehab Grant. Oh, okay, so on that portion that required a match of some kind or another. Right, so if you spend $800,000, I think it's two years, right? Two years ago, you get 80-20 match, but you still have to spend $800,000, so you know, to a certain degree, like if you get $800,000, you spend the $800,000, I'll just make it up, you're gonna earn $7.2 million or whatever it is. All right, you know, but if you spend less than that, your federal earnings go down, so you almost got to spend to a certain degree that $800,000, which kind of messes with your match, because you might get 80%, you might get 75% on the money. So in order to closer balance that, we would have to have those more folks in, I guess I should be happy that we don't have people who have to access this. You'd have to have more clients, basically. More clients, but from the standpoint of an opportunity to draw down that federal for folks with that disability, we've absorbed all of those, we've taken care of all of those folks, generally, that need that service. I think that's what. We have served all the people that come in. There is no waiting list, we are serving everybody that comes to our door. And that's a better way to say it. Thank you very much, thank you Mr. Chair. All right, next section is on page 485. This is for a one-time funding in 20, well in 25 of the St. Louis Society for the Blind and Visually Impaired. This is for a non-profit organization to provide enhanced independence and empower individuals and enrich lives of the people that are visually impaired or blind located in St. Louis. And I think that is run through AlphaPoint, which is a agency out there that works with that. Nope, nope, next section is AlphaPoint. That is actually the St. Louis Society for the Blind and Visually Impaired is the name of the vendor. The next section is for AlphaPoint and that's on page 490. This again was one-time funding in FY 25 of $500,000 to AlphaPoint, a non-profit organization that provides rehab, career training, employment service, education, advocacy for individuals Kansas City area experiencing vision loss. It was 500,000 GR.",FALSE,,
13,"The next section is a business enterprise section. So what this is, is there are, this is due the Randolph Shepard Act. The Department of Social Services actually has a contract for the meal services at Fort Leonard Wood. That money goes through Department of Social Services and we pass that on to a vendor down there who part, there's a blind vendor that partners with an agency to provide the meal services at Fort Leonard Wood. And it's 43.4 million federal funds. You know we see this every year and seven years for me and I still really don't understand this although maybe I just need to go read the Randolph Shepard Act which I admit I've never done. Maybe it be very obvious but you know this is a lot of money and it's just federal money but to be running through our budget and seemingly you know it's hard for me to realize what if anything we really have to do with this but and it's also hard for me to believe like are you telling me if we turn this away that nobody's gonna eat at Fort Leonard Wood like I find that hard to believe as well. So the problem is we own the contract now but you're right I mean if so what the Randolph Shepard does is it gives blind vendors preference for federal contracts around meal services. For these for the for the military that money has to go through us for them for the blind vendor to own it because we have to sign off on the contract. We you know there are vendors that provide services blind vendors that provide services at other federal institutions that don't run through us. This started I think in 2004 and like you said it's been around for a long time but the only way for that blind vendor to have that contract down there and they do contract with a provider down there that actually provides it but that does run through us but yeah I understand what you're saying. What is the distinction of the other blind vendors and contracts that that's that makes this one unique? This this is the way the military needed it set up is my understanding. So you're saying for those other vendors and those other contracts they're not DOD contracts? No not all of those are DOD this is a DOD contract. So that's the distinction as it relates to Randolph Shepard? As far as I remember as yeah all of them had to follow the Randolph Shepard Act. This is the only one that runs through us. My understanding is that's the way the Department of Defense that we have to pass that money through. And so if I'm understanding you correctly if we didn't do this they're still gonna eat at Fort Leonard Wood they just might not have the current vendor? Right or there would be a bid down there. I see okay. And so you're right but we still own the contract.So if we were gonna get away from doing this we'd have to give some sort of notice to the Department of Defense on this Representative Mayhew proceed now I think I probably ask this question every year also because I did did we get any kind of administrative fee for Running this through. No, the the blind vendor does get some administrative portions down there But this state does not get anything out of this. So we're we get involved in this. Just we're you said is our contract and The feds write us a check for 43 million dollars and we write a check to them for 43 million, correct? And I I'm like the chair. I've never understood this and understood why we did it I'm sure it's probably detailed in the federal legislation somehow My biggest question now and I think we I noticed this a couple years back is is that how The the number of trainees that go through Fort Leonard Wood stays pretty static But we see a lapse here on this line and I any regard general revenue I don't know why I'm worried about it But we go from three million laps to twelve and a half million laps back to 1.6 million laps And do you get any idea how that happens So is that a new contract every year or how does it work? So there is a new contract Yeah, their their census moves up and down From time to time plus it's based on a contractual amount That we have to provide purse Meal they serve now there was a new contractor that came on last year So we were paying off the old contractor and the new contractor through the Department of Defense but yeah, if you If you go look at our program description book at 257 it kind of details sort of the number of meals served so in 2022 we served 7.8 million in 2023 the vendor served 6.9 8 8 and this last year at 6.8 6 1 but there was also inflationary increases in that contract Due to the cost of food and the cost of serving the meals so that those all stand sounded With it certainly within the range, right? Right though. There wasn't that big huge difference It was just that one stuck out Like I said, I don't know why I'm worried about it because not GR But it just seems odd that that we even are participating in this. I'm with the chair on that one okay, and you're talking about that how it jumped up in 2024 to from 2023 the So we there was twelve and a half million in lapse in 2023 and then back to one and a half million which it was closer to the Sort of within a million. Anyway, that was due to switch over vendors During That time frame so we had one vendor and then we switched to a new vendor and so there were some carryover expenses That along went along with that Plus some billing things some timing of the the timing of the payments for that contract Sounds like we've got a lot of time invested in this thing. Correct every year.",FALSE,,
14,"So, okay. Well, thank you. Thank you.",FALSE,,
15,"Mr. Chair There's also a increase asked for the business enterprise for the contract of 1.2 million based on what we expect this meal senses and cost to be for this in 2026 Next section is child support field and operations page 504 So these are child support staff Located throughout the state. It's thirty five point three million total six million gr And 584 staff. So these are the staff that Do the child support enforcement functions do the wage withholdings in the overall program? Next is page 512 Clay County parenting court program. This is a one-time added in FYI 2025 of $50,000. This is the Clay County parenting court program to provide print parenting correct them support resources along with assisting parents in finding employment and they are partnering with March Inc. That is a current contractor for mediation Next section is the child support enforcement call center. That's four point six million Dollars sixty seven FTE and one point four six million gr So as individuals are calling into our child support call center, these are the staff that answer those calls Next to the child support on page 523 child support reimbursement to counties 17.5 million total 2.2 million So the county's all provide certain child support activities the legal enforcement Arm of a lot of these actions are handed out to the counties along with some of the administrative actions This is reimbursement to the local counties for their child support activities What is that on 523 the last Portion of the last sentence there in addition to the federal match on state funds This core is also funded with non matchable incentive payments. What is that non matchable is sort of so payments the incentive payments? That's a hundred percent federal money So it doesn't require a match. So the normal match for this program is 4d is 66% federal we also based on performance all states are sort of measured against each other and So we get a certain amount of 100% federal money. I think it's around 12 million dollars. And so a portion of this So if you look at you know, it's 2.2 million gr and 14.8 million federal in 400,000 other a Big portion of that federal comes from the incentive program, which is 100% doesn't require a match. Okay. I appreciate that I was almost reading that as maybe it was You know 100% gr not or you know that there was no federal match, but it's a all federal not requiring a state match What is the Like what exactly what are we incentivizing? Everyone's advising and we're incentivizing the counties to do what so this isn't Incentivized these are incentives that the state receives so For the 4d program as a state if you rank so high in like Your percentage of support collected your Paternity matches so they rank you turn in all your data You get ranked nationally the higher you ranked the more incentive funds the state receives Which is a hundred the incentive is that it's a hundred percent federal Incentive Payments and we're using these incentive payments by which we've received to help support this core item Yes, funny source. Yeah Perhaps that was abundantly clear to begin with but I appreciate you explaining that to me. Thank you All right, the next section on page 528 is a distribution pass-through This is thirty six point five million federal and six million other for a total of forty two point five million What this is is for federal tax intercepts when we intercept that money this gives us mechanism to either pay that money out to the custodial parent or Refund any Overages or collections in air back to the non custodial parent or the person that we intercepted it from You know a lot of laps here and I mean you go back a few years and Boy, we used used about all of it. I'm assuming that was probably kovat related Yes, but you know those stimulus checks have been fewer and far in between. I mean, do we really need? Of course we don't have as much of authority as we did but you know, we've still 42 million and yeah This is one of those approaches where we don't really control what we intercept That's that's the IRS intercepts and send it to us and we have so many days to get it out What happens that you're right is during the kovat year the feds decide what is eligible for intercept and what's not once they intercept that money if we don't have the authority to either pass that to the custodial parent or Return the portion back to non custodial parent then we have to sit on the money until we get a supplemental So it is pretty high we kind of ran pretty close back that one year when we did originally receive it So we had to come in with Basically a supplemental for that year. I think that was 2021 or 2020 so we've kind of been a little bit Larry about that But you if I understood you correctly, I thought you were saying initially that There is a requirement a set number of days that we have by which to pass it through But then I said if we don't have the authority we'll have to wait till a supplemental So kind of puts us at odds with the feds if we do that. Yeah But there's nothing they can do about it, yeah, okay.",FALSE,,
16,All right.,FALSE,,
17,"Got it. Thank you The next is the debt offset escrow transfer So this is like the previous one But instead of being federal money These are for state tax intercepts to pass that along to the custodial parent or back to the non custodial parent And that is the last section for FSD Okay, Jerry and Yeager's Brennan Key Department of Social Services Office of Workforce and Community Initiatives Page 538 is the funding for our staff for administration purposes Page 543 is for the community partnerships so there are 20 community partnershipsand the Family and Community Trust Board and so they're located in various parts of the state. They focus on six core areas, safe children and families, healthy children, children ready to enter school, so a lot of youth type of programs. Representative Lewis, you have an inquiry, you may proceed. Thank you. I see there's about an 8.2 million direct allocation that goes to the 20 community partnerships with the biggest, the largest share going to Arches and Link, the one in Kansas City, one in St. Louis. They also, this is the direct appropriation, is that direct appropriation for them to to administer grants that come from from DSS or is it for them to give grants to other entities? I mean what's the purpose of the direct appropriation of 8.23? So we have a list and like a breakdown and we can get that, I don't have it with me today, of what the 8.2 million dollars, some of its direct programming, some of its other administrative funds. I think if what you're getting to is does this support programs that are already being supported, beginning this year, at least for our programs, we went away from the direct percentage amount and for every one of their programs they are now required to give us a budget and a budget narrative outside of this, right, because this is the the core money, a budget and a budget narrative with their actual costs and they only get administration on allowable costs, which that's per OMB guidance, right, so they could get 15% but it's only of the first $50,000 per subrecipient plus their actual costs. So if you're if you're interested in seeing some specific budgets, I'm sure you are. You know I am. That's a big difference between what they were getting on a 3.7 million dollar contract at $370,000. If it was on $50,000 in the first, as you said, 15% on the first 50, I'd be happy with that change if that's and then you will have to keep in mind that we do also allow them to have direct costs though. So if they have a like a half of a salary of a staff person or a quarter of a staff person or whatever, they're going to get that plus their fringe too. So they'll have their actual and then they'll have the percentage that they can get on their modified total direct costs. So there's a few line items that they can get that on, including the subrecipient, but I'd be happy to provide you whatever you need. One of the interesting things I saw on this, this is from 2024 I believe, you know, with one of the entities they received about from this direct appropriation, you know, the 8.3 they got 1.785, you know, basically 1.8 million. Of that, their administrative cost for that money that they have was like 1%, but that's the money they're distributing to themselves, the money that they're, so to administer their own funds they're taking about 1%, but to administer the funds that we give to other entities they were taking 10% or more. Yeah and I'd have to look to see what the percentage total like comes out of every one because they're all different now.",FALSE,,
18,"There's no like one size fits all. Yeah that would be enlightening to me, I'm sure. I've got, I mean, lots of things but, you know, I do want to get out of here at 1030, so I don't want to belabor this, but I do think it's very important that if we allocate and appropriate money in the state legislature to go to after-school programs, that that money goes to after-school programs. If we allocate money to go to anti-trafficking, that it goes to anti-trafficking and it isn't intercepted, and then skim taking 10% off the top to administer something in indirect cost when it's not costing them anything to do that. I mean, I know there's some, but it isn't $700,000 to do the, to administer that one grant. Yeah, and they'll get the 15% on their direct costs and then each sub up to $50,000, so if the sub was $20,000 they'd get 15% on the $20,000, but if it was a million they'd get it on the $50,000, so. Have you looked at, do you have new contracts in place for them? Because I know I've got several of the contracts that we had from previous years and, you know, I don't want to give away the farm, so I mean, I'd like to see a copy of the new contracts as well. So it will depend, I know it's gonna vary. Right, so we do, this is the tough part of the year, right, and when we go through these, I can tell you if it's a community partnership or not, a lot of them we do have in place. There are some, I know we're already in February, that we're still trying to get proposals from entities and things like that because the TNF block grant is pretty restrictive on how you can spend it, but we definitely can get over what we've got, budgets, budget narratives. Sure, just last question, on this, these line items here, you know, you've got 8.3 and only, I know only $632,000 of that is GR money, but the other are also at least somewhat fungible federal monies that we can do other programs within the Department of Social Services with, correct? Yes. I mean, we're using this, these seven, you know, the $7.6 million is going to these programs, and I'm not saying that they're bad programs, but those funds could be used to fund other good programs inside of the Department of Social Services budget, correct? Correct.",FALSE,,
19,"Oh, I just wanted to make sure that that's, you know, out there that we understand that fully. I appreciate, and I'll be looking forward to that. I know that we're on a time crunch, so the quickest you can get that information to me, the better, because, you know, there's a bill working its way through, and the budget language is going to have to be drafted to make sure that, that what we have here is what we, what we ought to have. So, I appreciate it. Thank you. Representative Chappell, you have any query on this item, you may proceed. Just very quickly, Mr.",FALSE,,
20,"Chair, thank you. So, just to make sure I understand, the community partnerships, they get their, whatever their expenses are, they get reimbursed for that, and then they get 15% of the first $50,000 for each sub grant that they divvy out to others. Right, so that's the modified total direct costs and applying the federally allowable de minimis. So, how many subs do these partners typically have? It varies. Sometimes, like on the new decision items, like where it's intended to go to one entity, there's one. Sure. Right, there's some that they might have four or five. So, it's gonna completely depend on what the program is and what they've got going on with it, but the ones, like I said, that are very pointed at a specific project, there's gonna be one. Sure, but 15% of $50,000 is $7,500, so if you have multiples of these subs, it still adds up to quite a bit when you consider that they've also got their expenses reimbursed, and this is just on top of that, right? Correct.",FALSE,,
21,"Okay, that's all I needed to know. Thank you. Representative Mayhew, you have an inquiry, please proceed. Thank you. The last two in course pretty much exhausted what my questions were, thank goodness, but just to reiterate, you're gonna provide us with a list of those recipients broke down? Yes. Okay, and to include their total administrative payment? So, what we can do is I can give you the program, the community partnership, and then their their costs split out, like fringe, you know, personnel, fringe, and then the de minimis that applies to it, because they don't, they don't have a federal, they don't have a federally negotiated rate, so they're gonna use the de minimis. Okay.",FALSE,,
22,"Yes, we can, we can do that. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you. Please continue. Page 548 is Missouri Mentoring Partnership. So, this is, there are nine providers in the Family Community Trust Board. This provides participants 16 to 24 year olds at risk of receiving public assistance or even entering the juvenile systems with mentoring, worksite experience, and a young mentoring model with parents skills and, with parents and skills. Page 553 is the Adolescent Program. This, actually, this funding actually of $600,000 in TNF goes to the Missouri Alliance for Boys and Girls Clubs, and that, then they provide it out to 14 Boys and Girls Club that, clubs that cover 18 counties. It's for 10 to 14 year olds focused on healthy relationships and planning for the future. Page 558 is the Family Connection Pilot. This was one time of $1 million, and it is for the Family Connections Pilot Program through Greene County Health Department. The purpose is to provide free nurse, nursing, or free nurse home visits for all families with newborns less than 12 weeks of age. Page 563 is the West Central Moe Community Action Agency. It goes through the Community Action Agency. It's New Growth Transit, and this is cut, it has been in for 23, 24, and 25, so it continuously gets core cut and then placed back in there by the General Assembly. It was $1,884,922 in one-time funding, so this is a ride-share program that has volunteer drivers to help transport individuals to employment or medical trips. Page 569 is Jeff Franklin Community. They're calling that their program Easy Moe. It's the same idea as what West Central is, it's just expanding it, and this is the $30,000 of general revenue was one-time. They used it to purchase a van to transport individuals. Page 580 is the Skill Up program.Oh, I know why, okay. Sorry about that. I got out of order here. Okay, yeah, my book's out of order. Okay, gotcha. Page 575 is in St. Louis. It is the National Society of Black Engineers, $150,000 of TANF block grant funding. It was a one-time program. It's for the Center for Science, Technology, Engineering, and STEM Research, and it's to help youth understand and enter into engineering careers. Representative Murray, you have an inquiry on this item. You may proceed. Thank you, Mr. Chair. So with regard to this program, could you speak to a little bit about why you said it was a one-time funding? Was there a reason why it wasn't prioritized for 2025? So this is along with all the other ones that are zeroed out. Typically the General Assembly adds them in as one-times. We typically do not request funding back, and the administration usually does the same and then leaves it to the General Assembly to make the decision whether to appropriate again since they did fund it as a one-time. If they would have funded it as ongoing, that would have been back on request, but it was funded as one-time, so it would be based on the General Assembly's decision. Do you have any data in terms of the effectiveness of the program when it was funded? I do not have much with me right now because I think this is a newer program, just funded this year, but we can get you what data we have on it. Okay, I would appreciate that. I think I had read somewhere that over 500 students had majored in that specific area of focus, and the mentorship programs that they had were really beneficial to a lot of students in the area. And again, this program just started this year, so we will see what all data they have on that, and we can get that back to you. Okay, thank you. Okay, page 580 is the Skill Up program. So this is the employment and training program for individuals that are on SNAP. It has short-term training, skill building, soft skills trainings, they go through assessments, individual employment plans. There's a split of about $6.7 million in TANF, and the remaining funds come from the Food and Nutrition Service. We currently have 16 providers in 188 locations. That Food and Nutrition Service, I guess coming through 1610, what are the allowable uses of that funding? Is it more extensive than just for this, or could it only be utilized for this program? Are there other allowable uses? So that funding is specifically for this program. We get an allocation letter from the federal government that tells us exactly how much money we have for this program. Every state does, right? Of 100%, and then we have a 50-50 column, but yeah, it's just for this program. And does that award amount change year by year? It does change. It fluctuates somewhat. On the 100%, we've been as much as from about $1.3 million to $1.7, and it'll drop some. The rest of this money is 50-50 money, and we're currently in the process of putting out a bid to try to get more providers. On the 50-50 money, you actually have to use non-federal money to draw in federal money, so that's how we're trying to grow the program even further. So we don't provide the match. The agency we're contracting with provides the match for the program. Thank you for anticipating that question. So that doesn't show up. That'd be off-budget, I guess. Right. So if they show us $100... You can claim that. Yes. Normally, you can't, but under this program, we can. As long as it's non-federal, local match, they spend $100, we can reimburse them $50. We have been lapsing, you know, $3-4 million, so is that, you know, if we had more providers that would account for that, or we're just anticipating a larger federal award than we're actually experiencing in that food and nutrition service? We're lapsing the 50-50 portion of it, so that's why we're hoping to put the bid out to get more providers that have non-federal match to increase the size of the program. I thought the 50-50 portion wasn't on our side of the books. It's listed in the appropriate authority. The 50% is. So 50% is in our authority. So we've got to draw on the federal funds and pass it through to them. I see. We don't provide the match. We won't see the match in here, but we provide the 50% portion. Non-federal dollars. Got it.",FALSE,,close
23,Okay. I understand. All right.,FALSE,,
24,"Thank you. And is this, can you provide a list of who currently is the providers for this? Yes. I actually have it here, or I can get it later. Okay. Is it in the program book, or you just? I don't think. Okay. I thought if you could. I don't think they put anything in the program book. That's fine. I don't think they put anything on the page, but if it's, you can just supply it after the fact. Okay.",FALSE,,
25,"Yeah. That'd be fine. Yeah, I don't think they put any of the provider lists on this year. Okay.",FALSE,,
26,Thank you. Okay.,FALSE,,
27,"Okay. Page 585 is for the adult high schools, also known as the Excel centers. So the first one is the $3.15 million that we see on the page 585. So right now the Excel centers have four locations, Poplar Bluff, Columbia, Springfield, and St. Louis. They also have two satellites in Cape Girardeau and Florissant. This part of the money that you see here is SNAP, Food Nutrition Service. This is the money that they have to put up 50% to draw it. So this is where, this is the match thing that they're doing for the Excel centers. Representative Mayhew, you have an inquiry. You may proceed.",FALSE,,
28,"Yes. And so, back up just a hair, and then talk about this particular one at the same time. So on the Skill Up program, we're lapsing $4 million. And so what is the, I'm sorry, I missed it, I guess. So why aren't we taking advantage of that? That's all federal dollars. It doesn't look like it requires any kind of match. Is it, we just don't, can't come up with enough programs for folks to take advantage of? What's going on there? So of that, so $6.7 million of that is TNF. And then $4.7 million is FNS. Of that portion of the FNS money, only $1.3 million of that is actually 100% money. The rest of that is all 50-50 money. I know that still doesn't quite account for everything, but that leaves us with, what about $3.3 million or so, if my math is somewhat math, and yet I don't know. But it leaves us with about $3.3 million. So our lapse is mostly due to the 50-50, which we put a request for proposal out to increase the number of providers that use their own money, non-federal money, so that we could increase the program. So we've had that in there for a little while, we just haven't gotten the bid out. So why don't they do it? Why aren't these other providers, is it just because they can't come up with the 50-50 match, or what? So we've just started receiving bids on that money, and it's closing, I believe, in four to six weeks or so. So we'll know better in the next month or so how many people will do that. Historically, we have not put out bid for that money. It's been in here, but we have not put out a bid for that money until this year. And so we're doing the same, we've got a big lapse, once again, with no GR, and on that next on the page 585, but we're also asking for another $3 million NDI on that particular line. Or I'm sorry, the Governor is, anyway, wanting to put $3 million more on that line with that NDI. So we're lapsing, already lapsing a million and a half, what good's putting $3 million more in there if we're going to, so it looks like, to me, it'll end up being $4 million in lapse. So the Excel centers intend to use the $3.15 million in the 50-50, and then the previous 50-50 match, we put in a request for a proposal out on. So we're hoping that next year you don't see this like this again. Okay, so there's proposals in the works to consume the lapse and this additional $3 million? Yes.",FALSE,,
29,"Okay. All right. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Representative Steinhoff, you have an inquiry, you may proceed. Yes, I have a question about that NDI as well. I don't know if you have already really gotten to it or yet, but I know it says the plan is to increase services for the adult high schools. Is that a quantity or a quality type of increase to services? Have we moved to page 590? Is that? That's what, well, he was asking about it, but I can let you present if you haven't done it. Yeah, no. $3 million that is for the new Excel Center location in Kansas City. Oh, okay.Yes, TNF, sorry. I'm sorry, that's TNF. Okay, thank you. Thanks, Mr. Chair. Representative Lewis, you have an inquiry on this item. You may proceed.",FALSE,,
30,"I think maybe just a comment. I believe the three million dollars is for the new high school in Kansas City, the adult high school, and then as far as some of the expansion of services, you know, if they were to change the age requirement, which is one of the things that we're working on, lowering it from 18 to 21 as well, then you could increase the number of of service people being served at the same time, and I think that's one of the things that's trying to, you know, hopefully that we'll be able to get this money out the door, and then we're still, you know, obviously you need people are going to donate their 50 percent. I mean, it's obviously matching funds from local entities to provide the other half, and Excel is basically collecting that. I guess that's the right word I'd say, but I think, did I say all that correctly? Yes. Thank you.",FALSE,,
31,"Appreciate it. Page 592 is also Excel Centers, so they get kind of a variety of different funding. They get two million dollars, and that helps them. That's general revenue that will help them draw down the food and nutrition service money. They also get 4.9 million dollars in TNF money, and it's for the locations that we've already discussed. Page 597 is adult high school expansion. This, you'll see, it's lapsed last year, and the reason for it is right now they just brought up two new satellites not that long ago within the last couple of years. Just one second here, let me go back to my other page, and those satellites, like I said, were in Cape and Florissant, so they're still working on getting those up and going, and they have not at this point started the other satellite locations, but that is for expansion. Page 602 is Jobs League. This is 1.5, this was 1.5 million dollars in TNF in 25, and it's 850,000 dollars in TNF in 26. This is administered through the Workforce Development Boards, and it's a subsidized employment program for 14 to 24 year olds. Page 607 is Jobs for America's Graduates. This is 4.15 million dollars in TNF, so this is, this program is currently offered in 74 districts and 116 schools, and it assists students in overcoming barriers such as homelessness, they may have incarcerated parents, parents aren't employed, or a variety of other reasons, and they receive classroom instruction to graduate into the workforce school or the military. Page 612 is Community Work Support. So, this is the Missouri Work Assistance Program, and this, there's 1.855, a little bit over that, in general revenue, and 12,867,755 in TNF. This is the employment training program for people that are receiving temporary assistance for needing family benefits, also known as cash benefits. This program was expanded some years ago to also serve folks that are in skill up, and older foster youth, as some of the numbers had dropped on some of the other caseloads. Page 617 is the Foster Care Jobs Program, which we are all, we're calling Futures. This is administered by four Missouri Work Assistance providers, the ones that we talked about before, and nine community partnerships. This began in February of 2023, and it's an employment and training program for older foster youth, ages 14 to 23. It has the whole thing, like our other employment training programs, assessment, employability plan, job training. Page 622 is Employment Connections. And this is located in St.",FALSE,,
32,"Louis. It's $1 million in TNF funding, and it focuses on self-sufficiency by overcoming homelessness, and it is targeted towards veterans, high school dropouts, at-risk youth, and single parents. Page 627 is MoCan. That one is also in St. Louis. It is $500,000 in TNF funds. It is a pre-apprenticeship program for construction, and they include OSHA 10, and training on blueprint drawings. Page 633 is Mission St. Louis, obviously in St.",FALSE,,
33,"Louis. It's $2 million in TNF funds. And this is a governor's recommendation as a new decision item in 2026. It will serve individuals that are justice-involved, unemployed, underemployed.

Page 647 is the Office of Employment and Training, and it focuses on self-sufficiency in TNF funding. Representative Christensen, you have an inquiry on this. You may proceed. Thank you, Mr.",FALSE,,
34,"Chair. Just really quick, do you know the numbers that we spent in 23 and 24 since they said that we did fund them, but I just can't find them on these since it's only one page for page 633? I don't have it, but we can most definitely follow up afterwards. Yeah, no worries. Yep, I just want how much we spent, and then if you have the contract from 23 and 24, I would appreciate that as well too. Okay.",FALSE,,
35,"Thank you. Before we go to Representative Lewis, just to be clear, and you said NDI, but the tab would suggest that it's a core item, but it is most definitely not. It's a new decision item, correct, on 633? Yes. Okay, just to make sure everybody's on the same page here, because it would... No, it wasn't. Yeah, it's an NDI. It wasn't funded last year, so there wasn't a core, so... Say that one more time. It was not funded last year, so there's no core for this one, or not last... There's no funding for this in 2025, so there's no tab in the new decision item. Right, yeah, just so everybody's on the same page in case, to clear up any confusion that could or would cause. Representative Lewis, proceed with an inquiry. Yeah, I'd like to get your, the contract you have with Arches for number six, page 622 and 627, since that's also going to those community partnerships as a direct appropriation above and beyond the direct appropriation they're getting at of eight point, of their portion of the 8.3, so I just, and actually if whenever one of these comes up, I'd like to see those, the contract for those two, you know, just what, how much of that's going there, so, and you know, what, what percent is going to be direct and indirect costs for the administration of those funds. Thanks. Okay, page 635 is Southside Early Childhood, that is through Arches, and it goes to Southside Early Childhood, that's the actual recipient. It's $250,000, and one time it was core cut, so that was in 25, it was core cut in 26, and it provides child care to families in the St. Louis area, and it's $250,000, and one time it was core cut, so that was in 25, it was core cut in 26, and it provides child care to families in the St. Louis area, so basically when they're focusing on education, job development, and training relationships, things like that, this funding is providing the money for child care. Okay, I'm good. All right, that is it for book three. We will now move on to book four. Okay, page 640 though, right? Okay, all right, page 640 is the Megan Meyer Foundation, that is in St. Charles. It was funded as one time in 24 and 25 with TNF of $350,000. It was core cut, it's a public campaign on suicide and cyber bullying awareness. On page 645 is the Guadalupe Center, that's a new decision item from the governor for $5 million in TNF, so it provides reduced and free tuition assistance in fields such as IT, health care, logistics, service, careers, manufacturing, and construction. It serves Latino communities in Kansas City by operating charter schools, early childhood services, family support, older adult programs, youth development, and workforce development programs, and that was in Kansas City. So this is a, this recommendation is for ongoing funding, it's not one time? I couldn't tell. I mean, according to the budget book, it is, it's ongoing, I mean, according to the budget book, it is, it's ongoing, 646. Let me see. But these budget books have failed me more than once this year, so I'm a little timid. I think so.",FALSE,,
36,"To take it as the gospel truth. It is not coded as one time, so it is ongoing. Yep. And I agree, I'm getting used to these new forms, it used to be a lot easier for me. Yeah, I'm a little timid, but that's what it suggests, so I, but just so you confirm that.",FALSE,,
37,"We'll confirm that, but I'm pretty sure. Do you believe, so do we believe TNF can support this as an ongoing item, I mean, $5 million? Right now, the spend plan, there's, a lot of it depends on what lapses over this next year in the following year. Right now, our spend plan, I think we have around $900,000 at the bottom. We are appropriate higher than our grant of $200,000.and 17, so a lot of it depends on how many of these programs get their money spent, how much gets spent in cash assistance, things like that. So, difficult to say.",FALSE,,
38,"Sure. Why is this in your budget versus, say, Dudes? I would guess because it's TANF. Okay, and then, so speaking on that note, which purpose of TANF does this comport with? Because I'm just looking here, I mean, you know, free tuition assistance, adult learners. So, generally, we would, after something like this gets funded, assuming it gets good funded or any of them gets funded, we go back to the entity, we explain the TANF purposes, and we have that discussion. It may have some different ones in it. It looks like, you know, the very surface, it does at least have, you know, TANF Purpose 2 in it somewhat, but often when these get put in there, then we have to go back and have those conversations, right? Like, you have to be part of a qualifying household. We can only do the pieces and parts that meet the TANF block grant. So, right now, it looks like at least part of it is TANF Purpose 2. You may be able to get some of it under TANF Purpose 1, which, with your early childhood services, potentially, too, but that's a very deep dive once we actually get talking to the entity. Do we know, with the five million, do we have any insight as to exactly what that would go to support or to what level? If it's tuition assistance for adult learners, for example, how many adult learners that represents? Or, you know, do we have any kind of a spend plan as it relates to this? Not at this time, but we can see if we can get one for you. Okay.",FALSE,,
39,"Yeah, if one is available, then we certainly can get to it. I would say on TANF, they are, you know, there's been some guidance around educational uses of TANF funding, so. Sure. I mean, I understand we're in a much different place at this point today and this year than maybe we were where we thought we might be this year last year, but still, you know, those four purposes and just trying to understand how that fits. So, thank you very much for that, and seeing no further on this item, we can continue. Page 647 is a new decision item. Governor's recommended of 3.5 million dollars for Access Point in St. Louis. This is also a TANF block grant. It helps students from underrepresented, underrepresented communities transfer from high school to software development careers in less than a year. So, I'd have the same questions, but I'm not going to ask them again, but, you know, and you, you know, I'm sure that the answer would be the same as to it's ongoing, can it support it, and it'd be the same answer, so I, we don't have to go over that again, but to the extent you have any additional information about, you know, what exactly three and a half million dollars gets us as far as, it almost sounds somewhat similar, we're talking about educational sort of initiatives here, you know, how many students that represents, or if there's any supplementary information, if there's not, there isn't, but if there is, you know, to the extent you can provide that, we'd appreciate it. We'll see what we can get you. Page 649 is the Journey Foundation. It is located in St. Louis County. It was a one-time in 25 for $500,000 in TANF. It's an employment training program to promote economic independence through job preparation and financial independence. It was core cut in 26. Representative Boggs, you have an inquiry on this item, you may proceed. Yes, back to this new decision item on 647, and then on 648, it says the new decision item will allow for increased services, so the previous page is 4,500 software programmers. Of course, the 3.5 million isn't going to satisfy a 55,000 K salary, so where are these misplaces at? The 4,500, where's the shortage at? And then, as a new decision item, it looks like we're increasing some kind of services that's already applied, so I'm a little confused. So, I am aware that Access Point does already exist, just because I googled it, otherwise I don't know that I would have known, but I am aware it already exists, so it would be increasing services, but we're gonna have to go back and get information on where the data of the 4,500 came from. Okay, so I was just wondering if maybe the 3.5 million is adding to a program that's already existing, is that? That's what it appears to be, yes. Okay, yeah, so if somebody could point me in the direction of that, that'd be helpful. Thank you, Mr.",TRUE,"It helps students from underrepresented, underrepresented communities transfer from high school to software development careers in less than a year.",
40,"Chairman. Page 654 is, goes to Arches, and then it goes to Operation Restart. It's $500,000 in general revenue, and it is soft skills, employability, certifications, high sec, and then direct employer engagement, and this was core cut for this year, but it was one-time funded in 22, 23, 24, and 25. Representative Cross, do you have an inquiry on this?",FALSE,,
41,"You may proceed. Thank you, Mr.",FALSE,,
42,"Chair. Just checking in, do we, it looks like they had some kind of programming going, even though they were coded as one-time funds every year, and they did get a little beefy, it looks like, in FY 2024. Do you know, do they expect to continue with private support, or are they just completely ending the programming that they had going with with the youth builds, or? I don't know for sure. I know that every year they've gotten this back in the budget, so I don't know for sure how, what their plans are to proceed. I don't know. Again, every year this, it gets put in as a one-time, and so we kind of treat them all the same. Kind of starting from scratch. Yeah, no, yeah, it kind of starts from scratch, and then allows the General Assembly to make the decision again whether they want to fund them, you know, one-time, ongoing, etc. Okay, thank you. Representative Lewis, do you have an inquiry on the side of you? Yeah, can you get me for 2024, the amount that was actually, that actually went to the Missouri Work Program, and what amount actually was retained for indirect costs by ARCHES? Because if it was a 1.75 million dollar expenditure, they took 175,000 off the top, which would be something like 25% of what was actually expended. Just curious.",FALSE,,
43,"Okay. 650, 660? No, 654, right? My plug is a mess. You did that? Sorry, I'm having technical issues with my budget book. Okay, we're on the same page. I mean, literally, I think so now, but I have 654 left because you've got YouthBuild Works, which is Operation Restart, and then the next one I have is YouthBuild Works KC. They don't have a different, well, they're different, but yeah. So YouthBuild Works Kansas City is through the Full Employment Council. It was one-time funding $250,000 of TANF. It was core cut. It is for 17 to 24 year olds, an employment and training program with leadership development, technical skills training, financial literacy, and academic support. Page 660 is the Corey Johnson Foundation. It was one-time funding of $250,000 in 2025. It was also core cut. It's in St.",FALSE,,
44,"Louis. It's a youth wellness and enrichment program to promote healthy and safe lifestyle choices through arches, and the proposal isn't finalized yet. Representative Steinhoff, please proceed. Thank you. Can you tell me, it looked like that YouthBuild Works was funded with federal funds? I know we can't tell from this, but looking at last year, it looks like it had federal. The one in Kansas City for $250,000 was in TANF. I'm confused where the difference between the two are. Is that on page 655? I don't see Kansas City. Do you see? I think my book's next up. Can you tell them? The 654 is the YouthBuild Works. It was $750,000 last year. $500,000 of GR and $250,000 of TANF. TANF. Thank you. Okay, then we go to page 665, and this is kind of different. So it has six programs in this line item for $14.95 million, but then the six programs afterwards, we go through each one of them separately. So it has each one of the next six tabs, so we'll go through each one of those as they come up.but that's a combination of six programs. One moment. Representative Voss, please proceed. Thank you. You might be getting to it, but the ABC Today program had previously been called out as a separate line, and it looks like it's been folded into this 14 million. Is there a way for you to confirm what the allocation is planned for ABC Today? Yeah, so the allocation for ABC Today, and hang on a second. Actually, you're correct. They don't actually page them out at all, do they? Okay, well, I'll go through them then. So ABC Today is $1.5 million in TANF. Right. It goes from Arches to Big Brothers and Big Sisters, and it's offered in St. Louis and Cape Girardeau public schools, and helps with academic attendance, behavior, reading, and math. Correct, and I'm just trying to confirm that the $1.5 million that was in the previous budgets, does it look like it's in here, if I am looking correctly? Maybe I'm not seeing it yet. It's in the middle of the $14.95 million. And that's what I wanted to make sure, it got rolled into that, and it wasn't line cut. Yep, okay.",FALSE,,
45,"Yep. In addition to that program, Cochran Youth is also in this line item. It's $200,000 in TANF.

Thank you, Mr.",FALSE,,

That goes from Arches to Midtown Community Services, and it provides pre- and post-natal resources and education to ensure babies have a healthier start at life. Also included in this line item is, just a second, I got ahead of myself, sorry. It's out of order.",FALSE,,
47,"Okay. Are the food banks of $10 million. So this goes to the six food banks to help with the distributing of food to local pantries to serve all 114 counties and the city of St. Louis. Also in this line item is $2 million for a link for the Boys and Girls Club, and the after-school program does mentoring, academic success, healthy lifestyles, and good character and citizenship. And it would point out on both the food banks and their after-school programs, the state does leverage dollars that they put up. So like on the food banks, we give them 10 million in TANF. We are, it's kind of unique to certain programs like that, but we can get like 40 plus million of their local expenditures and use that as our TANF MOE, as a third-party MOE source. So these programs are a good public-private partnership on both the after-school program and the food banks that we give them federal funds and they're giving us 50 plus million of MOE to claim. Representative Steinhoff, you have an inquiry, you may proceed. Thank you. I'm looking on page 667, and it appears like from FY 22, 23, 24, expenditures were around 30 million. And then 25, that's a pretty serious reduction in appropriation. And then this year is going down another. Can you, because I can't see how all that's broken out. Can you tell me kind of where those cuts are? I would have to go back. So a lot of this wasn't cut to, these were broken out a little bit last year differently. So a lot of that was transferred to different sections and broken out separately. Okay. Instead of having it one big section, different programs were in different sections. So are you kind of saying that 30 million might still be being spent overall? Yeah, we can go back and try to look at where we can go back and get that kind of where that got transferred to last year. Okay, so you, but you don't think there was really a reduction of $15 million for, okay. Thank you.",FALSE,,
48,"Not that I recall. I'll try to go back and look and piece that together for you. Okay, thank you. For this one, that 2025 is just the current year to date spent as the 15.9 million. Is that the end of January? The end of December. But it's still, yeah. But yeah, the appropriation did go down in FY25. The year to date spent is 8.3 million. I can go back and look and see how that money was broken out separate and lay that out for you. I've got it here somewhere, but. I know.",FALSE,,
49,"Okay. Representative Boggs, you have it in green. May proceed.",FALSE,,
50,"Yes. Page 665, where we was, so we have the temporary assistance, which started in, it looks like it was created in 1996. What is the rollover of that? When we think of temporary, what kind of timeframe and how do we graduate, for lack of a better word, so when we think of temporary, so it talked about here one place, talking about preparation for work and promoting job preparation and that. So how is, what's this look like as a funding source, as a temporary funding source? What does this look like? So the name of the grant, and I think the grant levels have been pretty consistent through all of the years. So the actual funding itself, obviously is used for cash benefits. Now that piece of it, you're limited, the recipients are limited to 45 months. And then the remainder of that is, through the general assembly process, allocated to different programs. So I think from the temporary assistance piece, the cash piece, when you look at that, it is only so many months. They can only get 45 months. Okay, and then if they still need needs, then they go to a different program or do they reassign? Do we keep trying or do they tap out, I guess? So the 45 months is a lifetime limit. In certain situations, it may be longer than that if it's a child only case. So like the parent isn't getting it on themselves, it's only on the child. But generally after the 45 months are over, they're over. Now that doesn't mean that they're not receiving potentially SNAP benefits or a Mohealth Net or just getting energy assistance, I don't know. But there are very strict requirements on the cash side and they have to participate in the employment training program. The majority of them do, there's some out. I think that's where my question was leading. So thank you, I think that answers my question. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Representative Lewis, you are recognized. Do you know if these afterschool programs here, are they duplicative with afterschool programs in the budget in DESE? Isn't there a budget item in DESE that's also for afterschool programs? I believe that got moved back to our budget this year. Oh, so it's just swapped? They do have some afterschool programs but the certain ones were moved back to us last year. They've kind of got moved into DESE and then moved back to, so they're just kind of keep sliding one way, okay. They may have other afterschool programs that I'm not aware of, but the ones we're talking about got moved back to us last year. And what was the amount that, did you have that amount that was broken out? I haven't made it there yet. We're not there yet. Okay, no problem, I'll wait. Okay, page 672 is Serving Our Streets. Also was named Save Our Streets at one point and it goes to Arches. It was one time in 23, 24, and 25. It was core cut in 26. It's 1.5 million in budget stabilization. That program focuses on anti-crime activities, gun violence awareness resources. Page 678 is for Arts Tech and that is in Kansas City. It is general revenue of $1 million and it is a construction project and it's a construction project to improve existing infrastructure to provide a safe, healthy, and equitable learning and teaching environment for youth. They're an employment and training provider in Kansas City. Page 683 is for Boys and Girls Club of the Heartland or Poplar Bluff. It is one time and that is to fund the construction of a regional workforce development teen center in Poplar Bluff. Page 688 is for Canby's Market in Kansas City. It's $100,000 in TANF. It is one time funded program and it is a food delivery system to make fresh, affordable, and healthy foods to people experiencing food insecurity. Page 693 is the Chris Harris Foundation, $100,000 in TANF block grant. It works to develop self-esteem, basic life skills, and educational programming. It was also, it was core cut. Page 698 is Lyric's Institution. It's in Kansas City. It's $100,000 one time general revenue and it is a program that allows students to work in creative arts and take part in paid internships. Page 703 is Living with a Purpose. That one goes to Arches to Family Wellness and Education Enhancement Program, $230,000 in TANF. It is funded.again it is recommended to be funded again I apologize and it is an educational educational employment training they also do high set high set preparation I just you know your pastor high school literacy and mathematics and certified trade page 708 is Rosa Sharon ministries and that goes from arches to Rosa Sharon at seven hundred thousand dollars or seven hundred thousand I'm sorry I am seeing zeros seventy thousand dollars in general revenue it works on group mentoring professional development training skills exploration and training of youth age 713 is the one I believe representative Lewis was asking about this is the out-of-school enrichment the reason recipients are arches and link seven million two hundred sixty five thousand dollars arches receives 1,000,000 886 863 link with the remainder of 5,000,000 378 137 and it is a school child care program provides children with safe and healthy environment and learning activities during non-school hours you there's an elusive an inquiry you may proceed I don't want to beat a dead horse but let me do the calculation so there's two this is going to arches and link one point whatever you said 1.5 to arches and the remainder going to link is that what you said one point almost 1.9 close yeah okay so so if we were saying 1.9 in the previous way of calculating they'd save they'd take a hundred ninety thousand off of it the way you're saying you do the calculation now is since it's a separate entity of 50,000 of the first 50,000 you take 15% correct I need to verify on this contract that they did that that way and I'll get back with you for sure because this one's a little bit different that it can't transferred back to us I'll have to verify that on the new contracts well I'd love to see what it was on the old contract and then we can see if the new contract was applied how much how many thousands or millions of dollars it would save for the end using recipients I thought that I want the you know I don't want the money to go to after-school programs I want the money to go to the after-school program that's not the problem it's I don't necessarily want it to get intercepted and not go to the after-school program so I mean just to make sure I'm clear so yeah I think we've got we're getting that covered representative black you recognize for an inquiry Thank You mr. chair how's this may distribute is it per an RFP or what's the mechanism how's it determined which after-school programs this money goes to these were set up years ago so I don't know how these are direct to our community partnerships so they would be grants to the community partnerships Lincoln arches the amounts were set up I'm not sure how long ago it's not an RFP it's just a continuing grant you believe yes it would be a continuing grant I don't know if it originally there was an RFP meant multiple years ago or not so let's say a school and representative Lewis's district want to participate in this how might that be done probably through either the appropriation process or we'd have to look at doing you know work with the community partnership in that area or through an RFP yeah thank you page 718 is the Community Service League and independence it's five hundred thousand dollars in TANF and one-time funding and it helps individuals obtain permanent housing and case management with access to showers hot meals and laundry services and that was one time and core cut page 723 is good dads as a statewide program it was 1.5 million dollars and 25 but 1 million of that was one-time funding and 26 is five hundred thousand dollars it's healthy marriage and fatherhood initiatives to connect families with resources to provide financial assistance to their children establish legal paternity and participate in parenting task page 729 is alternatives to abortion that funding is provided to ten contractors and there is a total of 42 sub recipients six million dollars in TANF two million dollars in general revenue and then 50,000 of 610 and basically these are pregnant this this money goes to pregnancy resource centers and provides a whole a whole variety of services to ensure healthy births page representative Voss you have an inquiry on this item you may proceed thank you where can we get the list of the ten is that in the program book or just a quick scan on my computer I'm not seeing that but it may be it's not they didn't put the listings in the program book I have it and we can get it to you would you please follow up and email it to us representative Lewis you have an inquiry inquiry you may proceed and with this four million dollars it's going to these anti-abortion clinics is it going to these entities as a direct appropriation because we already I've we've already identified that the ten of them right so are they is a direct appropriation or is there a pass-through yeah these are a bid process some years ago and so it's going through the ten entities based on their bid going straight to the entities yes no pass-through in between okay great did you hit the NDI I mean representative Lewis was referencing the NDI the four million no you're fine and I think we were on the core 729 and I don't know I mean okay I understand now I'm sorry so on the four million dollars on page 735 that's actually a different answer so I need to backtrack we if that that funding goes through on the governor's recommendation of the four million dollars I don't know exactly how we will proceed with that money at this point because going through a competitive process will take us a very long time there are some potential options on qualified vendor lists and things like that but I don't know that we know right now until we get the money what what we can feasibly do in a very short time frame representative black you have an inquiry may proceed Thank You mr. chair what what do you mean going through the competitive process would take us a very long time so right now the the core program for alternatives to abortion it was competitively bid normally a competitively bid process takes you nine to twelve months so once we have the appropriation we have the authority once the bill is signed we can start going through an RFP process so what you would look at is do we just increase the existing providers do we look at the need you know we would have to go back and look at the need out there based on services individuals and so you can add some to the existing providers who did do an RFP and a competitive bid process some time ago yeah and so if we added a new RFP process that will take nine to twelve months to get that money out and that original RFP process for example did it have an option to continue the program in the state at certain level or is it just it expired and we just keep I would have to go back and look at that original RFP on how long because it is running on renewals right now it's up in what two years yeah I believe it was 27 is that when it's over so it's the the the contracts up at the end of 27 okay and we're gonna right we're gonna rebid it either way but the question on the four million dollars becomes you know what what's the in we don't really know but what's the intention of that funding is that we is it that we increase the current contracts or is it that there's about a hundred pregnancy resource centers in Missouri and about 50 of them are getting money right now or is the or is the intention that we somehow split up that four million dollars I don't know but we don't know the answer on what we're gonna do with it yet yeah so I'm confused about that so if we had an RFP out and somehow under that process the money got distributed according to the parameters of that RFP and it went to these centers do you think you'd have the flexibility under that contract just to up the amount they're getting based on this four million dollar addition it depends on how the RFP and things were worded so we'll go back the RFP and go back and look at the need on on where the best use of that money would be so if we can access those entities through the RFP we would do that if not then we would have to release a new RFP just for this four million dollars and you say it takes nine twelve months so if you get money in the budget maybe by the end of the fiscal year you'll have the ability to distribute pursuant that new RFP if we can get it out and done in nine months you're probably I mean best case scenario even if we fast track it and put it as higher priority you know you're probably talking February March for this money gets out the door if we have to do a full-blown RFP if we can just use the RFP I think it was a couple years ago that we did on this that would fast track it and then you would still do your the new RFP would be for 2027 and so is that standard is that been the standard for several years that it takes nine to twelve months to complete the RFP most RFPs will take nine to twelve months thank you representative Boggs you have an inquiry you may proceed yeah I just kind of stay on the same topic there you know we I don't think we want to reinvent the wheel I think there's places that's doingon this. I know there's a lot of places like our businesses that we we donate diapers and different things.",FALSE,,
51,"So, uh, to maybe to not create this lapse, maybe, uh, because I know they raised money as well. Maybe turn it into a match of some sort as well, uh, to give a little incentive to play, play harder and maybe get it out a little quicker to someone that's already in the business. That's that's my two cents. Thank you, Mr Chairman. Any additional, uh, questions, inquiries on this? If you had, uh, if you had this in the supplemental, would that help you fast track it? It would, it would help by about two to three months. I mean, again, once we can't really move forward most times with RFPs until the bill is signed, but yeah, it would, it would move it up two or three months, yeah. Yeah, I mean, I'm struggling a little bit with this logic because, and maybe it's just not a priority, but on certain things, but, you know, we put up, which I get this isn't a capital improvement type initiative, but, you know, we put it, put it in for, uh, you know, in a bill, then even if it can't totally be expended in one year, if it's one time, the idea is that it gets expended at some point, so the, you know, maybe ask for it back to get it out and get started on it, but maybe that's not been the, uh, the thought process and time has passed. I don't know. Well, it kind of depends on what it is, and, and so for our procurement process, if it is something that we can do a single feasible source, so there's fewer providers, then you can really limit it down and, and, and move faster on procurements like that, or if it's set up in the budget a certain way, if you've got to do the full-blown RFP, again, it's, you know, everything procurement always tells me it's around nine months to get something out the door, sometimes later if there's appeals or things like that, but yeah, it's, if we did a new RFP to reach additional people, then you would have to go through that process. Representative Lewis, do you have an inquiry?",FALSE,,
52,"You may proceed. I think it's maybe to inquire of you, perhaps, or, or, and, and both, maybe a double-dial. If you can do both at the same time, but. Yeah, so if we. Start with me. Yeah, if we. And I yield. Thank you. If we targeted the four million to a specific entity, then they could distribute it to the other entities, correct me if I'm wrong, that you already give money to. Is that not true? It, again, it depends on what serve, different services are different things in different areas, so if there's something that'll, it's a lot harder if there's a lot of entities out there that provide this service, to justify sending it to a single entity to distribute, distribute, distribute it. Again, we, you know, in the realm of the community partnerships, we're able, on some different type projects, you're able to do that because we have grant-making authority directly in that pre-existing relationship. We have not done that with A2A because we wanted to have that direct relationship with those providers in the past. So, again, you know, if you're gonna reach new providers, it'd have to be an RFP process here, unless you went through existing, somehow went through existing contracts with the intent to have them redistribute it, but it would have to be something we have existing on the books today. All right, thanks.",FALSE,,
53,"Okay, I think we can continue. Thank you. Page 737 is St. Paul Saturdays. It went from Arches to the St. Paul Mentoring, $126,000 in Tina Flock grant one time, some male mentoring program to assist in achieving academic, emotional, and spiritual success, and it was core cut in 1926, and that's St. Louis. Page 743 is a pregnancy resource grant. That was $2 million in general revenue put in as one time last year. Right now, they, we are in the process of getting that out very, very soon. We basically split it up evenly and said providers could get one time up to $19,000 for expanded services to ensure that we were able to get it done this year, and we call the qualified, but they had either be a pregnancy resource center or a maternity home. If there are any funds left after that distribution, we will redistribute it to those that bid, or that basically, so it's a little bit different. They're basically going to tell us what they're going to do, and we have a list of things like parenting classes, ultrasounds, pregnancy tests, life skills, referral services, safe sleep, and they can just basically put other, and so this was modeled after another state. Yeah, so you do, your intention is and belief, you think we will be able to expend most or close to all of the the appropriation, the $2 million, and if this was, this was one time, which is why we're seeing it, you know, core reduced here obviously is put in the house and included obviously in the truly agreed version, new for fiscal year 2025. If this was brought back in some form or fashion, would it, I mean, obviously any prior experience would be, I would think, informative, but would it expedite things in the future? Would you be able to, or would you look at handling a different way, or I don't know, what, how would your current experience inform any future, if this was, say, brought back? So I think it would go quicker because we had quite a bit of discussion on do we put pregnancy resource centers and maternity homes, and you know, looking at the house bill language versus how it was implemented in another state, so I do think it would go quicker because we've learned quite a bit, and we're gonna learn quite a bit once people actually start submitting, you know, proposals into us. Sure.",FALSE,,

Yeah, which other states are we looking at, and do they have any guidelines that would help us in this process?

It helps black families through pregnancy and parenthood journeys to eliminate racial disparities in maternity and infant mortality. Like I said, one time it was Corkite in 26. Page 753 is Saving Our Children, that is going directly to them. It has a split between opioid and TANF of $500,000 and $500,000.

This provides funding to 19 Community Action Agencies based on a formula, and they basically do a community needs assessment to determine what they will do in their area.

57,"Chair. I suspect I know how this got started, but what's the, what's the rationale for expenditures limited to a specific county like this? It was placed in through the General Assembly process. Oh, I'm sure, but I have no doubt that's what happened. But other than, other than the fact that a specific member of the General Assembly was successful in doing something for their home county, is there any, is there any rationale for having a program specifically limited to a county within, out of a hundred and fourteen? It's probably in the House Bill language. I mean, and so, yeah, it depends on the program, so I'd be hesitant to say, because we've got a bunch of these in our House Bill the last couple years, and it's, they lay out the demographics for that county, but to answer your question, sometimes I think these are organizations specific to that county. And so... When did this, when did this go into effect? This process, this is just this, this program just this year, are you just talking the general process of adding county-specific items? No, I know that's been going on forever, and you know, cities not within a county, I get all that, but this particular program for Crawford County, this is brand-new? Yes.",FALSE,,
58,"Okay, thank you. Okay, page 769, it's Community Assistance Council in Kansas City, $500,000 and one-time TANF funding.and it empowers individuals and families to self-sufficiency through emergency assistance for rent, utilities, and food and hygiene items. Page 774 is a Project 360 Youth Center in Lebanon. It's 1 million dollars in general revenue, it was one-time funding, and it was to fund the construction of an 18,000 square foot teen outreach facility. Page 779 is the Community Assistance Council of Kansas City. It's $500,000 in general revenue, one-time. It is to fund the construction of a community center used to deliver direct emergency utility and rent assistance, as well as food and hygiene items. Page 784 is the food distribution that goes to the six food banks. So there is funding in there for, from the Emergency Food Assistance Program, almost 6.8 million dollars. There's also funding for the Local Food Purchase Agreement. That funding does go to the community partnerships, and that funding will be over effective 930. If you've heard anything about LFPA, there is LFPA 25 out now, but we haven't quite made it there yet. But that's the split in that program. Representative Murray, you're recognized for an inquiry. Yeah, to inquire, and thanks Mr. Chair. First, I just want to say I'm thankful for this program, like the department's request, as well as the governor's recommendation, and I've witnessed firsthand like how so many families benefit from these type of food banks year-over-year, from all different types of backgrounds. But my question is in regards, if you look on 785, a year-over-year FY 22, 23, and 24, the unexpended funds, the lapses, could you speak to like potentially why those exist? I'd have to, we'd have to go back and look at the actual laps because just like right now, we have authority of about 5.6 million dollars in LFPA by itself, that chunk of it, but we only have about 2.39 million dollars left. Partially it's timing, partially is when the numbers are ran, but we can go back and take a look and see. Yeah, and then I see that it's distributed like from the USDA grant, and did you reference that it was ending at some point? So the TFAB, which is the Emergency Food Assistance Program, so that's your food that you normally, you know, think of that comes from, you know, through the federal government and then through the food banks. That's not.",FALSE,,
59,"Okay. The local food purchase agreement is ending. It is, there is another one coming out, LFPA 25, but we have not figured out how that's going to be administered yet because they don't have administrative funding in it at the federal level. Okay, and in the program book you reference technical assistance for the 14, would you refer to them as like LFPA providers, like what does that technical assistance look like? Can you tell me what page you're on please? It was in a program book, 445, I don't know if you have it in front of you or not, but I would imagine it must be rolled into like the administrative cost of whatever you all spend in administration. Okay, so the first part goes through the TFAB and food distribution. So like the second to last paragraph. Okay, yeah, so DSS is responsible for providing ongoing technical assistance to the 14 LFPA providers, so we do host ongoing calls with them to discuss things such as whatever federal rules there are, like you know, you can only purchase food within 400 miles, it has to be in the state of Missouri, you know, if there are rule changes on what we can charge admin to, to what we can't. So that is us just staying on like this is where we are, this is what we have to do. Okay, and I don't know if you can answer this one as well, but on the next page in the program book on 446, the projections, I see like FY 2025-26 is kind of hovering around 2.2 million participants. How did you all come up with those projections? So that's information that we get from the food banks. The 2.05 to 2.6 to 2.24, honestly we went back and forth on those discussions and I really don't know, you know, like it's hard to say like is there gonna be some inflationary issues, is there gonna be economy, so, so we, we just kind of left it the same because we really don't know. Yeah, this 2.24 million is duplicated numbers, yeah, they could come in month over month. What it could also affect is how many different times an individual comes in in a year. That's fair. Okay, well thank you so much and thank you Mr. Chair. Representative Taylor Dell, you're recognized for an inquiry. Wonderful, okay. Seeing nothing further, we can proceed. Thank you. Page 790 is the energy assistance program. So this program provides energy assistance and crisis assistance. It goes out to, it goes out to the majority of community action agencies to administer and then there's also two other participants. In addition, 10% of this goes to the DNR weatherization program, that's by federal regulation, and the weather, so on the energy assistance program there's a one-time payment that they can receive from October through the end of May, but then crisis, we have winter and we have summer crisis where they can apply because something's occurred. On page 796 is capable kids and families, that's the community partnerships of the Ozarks. It's $165,000 in TANF, it was one time. It's located in Phelps County and it connects families of children with developmental delays and disabilities with resources and services, so that was core cut in 26. On page 801 is Belfontaine neighborhoods. It is one time of 275, oh sorry, ongoing, I lied, not on purpose. Okay, so that was ongoing of $275,000 in TANF and that's development of a youth workforce program and it is focusing on green careers and urban forestry, things like environmental planning activities. On page 806 is Habitat for Humanity, that is also through Arches. $500,000 in general revenue for 25, but $250,000 of it was one time, so for 26 it is $250,000 in general revenue again, and it helps St. Louis families with the opportunity to build and purchase their own homes at affordable prices, and it also provides education on home ownership. Page 811 is under domestic violence. We provide funding to 61 providers, general revenue of five million, is that right? Okay, five million dollars, TANF of 1.6 million, 610 of 3 million, and it provides, it supports communities through shelters and support service to relate to the well-being and recovery of victims and their children. Page 817 is emergency shelter domestic violence. There's 62 providers. It is $562,137. It funds emergency shelters on a contractual basis to provide emergency support to TANF eligible victims. Page 822 goes to Shelters for Women. It is going to Amethyst Place in Kansas City. It was $100,000 in one-time TANF funding, and it provides emergency shelter services to victims of domestic violence with a history of substance use. Page 827 is Giving Hope and Health. It is $50,000, it was $50,000 of TANF for 25. It was core cut in 26, provides wraparound services and essential resources to end poverty to victims of domestic violence. Page 832 is Diamond Diva Empowerment Foundation, and that is in St. Louis. It was $100,000 general revenue. It was core cut in 26. They are also a domestic violence provider. They have a housing program, a healing program, and a workforce skills program. Page 837 is Kathy J. Weinman Shelter. That is actually, goes through St. Louis County Health Department. It was one-time of $1,000,000 and 25 core cut in 26, and they provide shelter and services to abuse women and children. Representative Prouty, you have an inquiry, you may proceed. Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman. Kathy J. Weinman is proudly in my district, and it of course is the St. Louis County being the largest county. They are going to use some of those funds, or most of those funds, to expand the program from the 36 beds. Now mind you, it's 36 beds for what, 1.2 million people, and so with the committee's help, I would like to see more so that they can continue to build out. Again, it's the largest county in the state with over 1 million people, and 36 beds are just woefully insufficient. Thank you, Mr.",FALSE,,
60,"Chair. Representative Lewis, proceed. Oh, there's several of these we've seen in a row. I mean, many of these allocations that are $100,000 here, and $100,000 here, and $1 million there, they look like they're all for very similar types of things. Shelter for women, and they're...children from domestic violence or whatever. It looks back on page, I mean, page 811, we've got all this unexpanded federal money. It's, you know, about, well, we'd cover all those things, but I'm not sure if they can be applied to those. I mean, you've got six million dollars of lapse in 2024. Can they not be used for any of those those type of things instead of us one funding, one-time funding? I believe the lapse in the last couple years was we received stimulus funds, so as you see each year we're lapsing it, but then the overall gets cut as those stimulus funds goes down, and so a lot of that is, as we're spending it over the these different years, the full amount was in there, but each year it goes down. Yes, I mean, I see that there's three funds there right there. You got your TANF, you've got your General Department of Social Services fund, and other sources, and then you've got 2456, which is the stimulus line, or the stimulus fund. Yeah. Are you saying that the majority of that lapse is stimulus fund, or is it... I would have to go back and look, but I believe so. We already have contracts with these, you've already established contracts with these other entities that we are not funding this budget, but currently for these. So, these providers that are that are lined out in here for funding, we are actually amending contracts we already have with some of them. So, like Diamond Divas, we already have a contract with them, so they're getting additional funding through their current contract. Kathy J Weinman, that goes to St. Louis County, we can contract with them. So, a lot of them already have contracts, and we're putting the extra dollars that are allocated during this process in here. Is there a way, maybe you can look and see if it's possible to fund several of these hundred thousand, these things here, through the line item, which is 11.325, or if all that money is just lapsing, that if it's just stimulus money, we can't do that, but if we have other monies that are in the same budget line item, it seems like we ought to be able to move some of it to that. Maybe that's illogical, but it seems like it isn't to me. Well, yeah, so the problem is we'll have to look and see if that lapses stimulus, because like when we run those numbers, it's a lot earlier than now. The problem is that if we try to go and amend those contracts and just give money to one or two or three providers, every provider in those contracts want more money. So, you're going to have 62 providers in one contract that wants more money, and 128 in another one. So, there's not been a way for the department to just pick out, like, you should get money, and you extra money, and you shouldn't. So, that's kind of how these have started popping up. Right.",FALSE,,
61,"Appreciate it. Okay, page 842 is Diamond Diva. It's $400,000 in TANF. It's the same program that was spoke about a little bit earlier. It has two separate line items. Page 847 is Victims of Crime Act. This is the administration portion of the program. On page 853, we actually get into the program itself, and it supports 129 contracts for child advocacy centers, court-appointed special advocates, domestic violence shelters, prosecuting attorneys, legal aid offices, underserved agencies. Page 860 is for Services for Victims of Sexual Assault. It provides funding to 61 domestic violence shelters and resource centers, and the services include professional therapy, crisis intervention, case management. Did I miss one?",FALSE,,
62,"Oh, I didn't do that one. Representative John Black, you have an inquiry. You may proceed. Thank you. I think it's the one you identified. You missed NDI on the vocal. So, an obvious question with this history that's described, and I know, so it could just tell us why over the years we have this kind of up and down and up and down on 24. Page 854 says decrease in federal, increase in GR, 25, decrease in GR, increase in GR, and then you're showing this gigantic federal lapse, and then we ask for another 25 mil of GR. Can you explain all that? So, the actual federal award has went up and down dramatically over the years. 18 was all the way at 61.8 million dollars, and it dropped to 41, then to 30, then to 19, and it came up a little bit more at a time. We've had more appropriation authority outlined in the budget than we actually gave out in grants. We've been giving out grants of about 48.2 million dollars total, and in the federal award is very hard to follow. Like in 24, there was some early anticipation that we would get a much larger grant, but it ended up being 14.2 million dollars. So, the rest of it was backfilled with general revenue through the General Assembly process. This year, the new decision item, which I totally skipped over, is also trying to help with some of that issue, and that we don't know what we're gonna get. Is it gonna be 14 million dollars, or is it gonna be some other amount? This particular fund is complicated in that it relies on people collecting fines and fees and very large lawsuits, and so it is not a consistent funding source at the federal level. So, at the state level, you see always see these GR pickups. Yeah, so I think that means if the Fed comes in the way we would hope it would, or the VOCA fund, then we wouldn't spend this 25 GR. Thanks. Yeah, at the federal level, they have promised fixes for many years. This is another one of those where we had a fix we thought four or five years ago, and then it wasn't, and they thought they fixed it again, and it wasn't, so. Representative Boggs, you may proceed. Representative Chappell, you may proceed. Thank you, Mr. Chair. So, I'm understanding what you're saying. You've got the appropriation authority that's been asked for based upon what you think the national government is going to do, and then they don't hand you down the amount of money that they thought that they were going to, and that explains why we had the lapse as we do over the last three years, is that correct? Yeah, to a certain degree, yes, and then these grants last for four years, so we had a large carryover of grants that we've been burning down those last couple years, and we're basically out this year, even with the generous support that the General Assembly has thrown into this program with both GR and some ARPA funds in the past. Again, it's 48 million dollars in what we're currently funding today, and we're getting 14 million. Now, could that go up? Yes. Could it go down? Maybe. Yes, probably. We won't, sometimes we don't know until next June or July. We probably got more authority in there and what we need at this point, but depending on how we spend money, if you can carry some of those federal funds over and have a little bit more next year, it would be helpful, but it's all a guessing game and that's the problem with this program. We're pretty much playing a guessing game with the Federals. So the fact that we've only spent, and I say only in the context, but 18.3 million for this fiscal year, I mean, we're more than half over for the fiscal year, so I mean. Yeah, we won't spend the full federal authority in there this year. So then why the 25 GR, 25 million of GR? Because that's just authority, that's not actual cash. So we've got authority to spend 40 million, but we haven't been getting 40 million from the feds. This last year we only got 14 million, plus we had carryover grants from the year before. So, but are you telling, are you saying that the program itself needs to be at 40 million dollars? However we get there, that's where, that's the right number? We have, and so I don't know what the right number for this is. When we bid it, we typically get way more bids than what we have money, no matter what we set it at. Right now, to maintain the program as is would take 48 million. So whatever the right number is kind of up to whatever federal funds we get and whatever the administration, the General Assembly decide to supplement the lost federal funding by. But it's a 48 million dollar program today. Yeah. I don't know if that helps or confuses. No, no, I understand what you're saying. So that's, I'm just trying to clarify my own mind. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Chair. There's really, I mean, going back to the Quorum 853, asking for 49 million federal for 26, I mean there's no way we spend 46 or 49 million in federal in FY 26. Maybe eventually if they ever fix it, which is, you know, seems, you know, almost hard to believe as well at this point for as long as that's been dangled in front of us. And for my part, I've started to tell folks, I mean, you know, it sure would be nice if the federal government could figure this out. It seems like this is the one place in which they can't seemingly figure out how to spend money they don't have, which I get that this was, you know, on, not disallowances, but ill-gotten gains that were recouped at the federal level and for some reason they're having trouble getting those ill-gotten gains back to us these days. But I think we're gonna have to figure out another way on the state level other than GR to continue to fund these initiatives, should we continue to fund these initiatives, because, you know, we obviously just can't sustain that support forever andAnd again, I don't think there's anything you disagree with, and it's, you know, you all are just trying to do what we're tasking you with, and I understand that. That's more for, again, I've shared that with certain members of this committee, and those in the state and the provider community that care about this. And I think we all, generally, I mean, it's very important work that's going on here, and, you know, they need a funding mechanism that's more sustainable than these federal dollars that are clearly not, and general revenue that's soon not to be. Representative Taylor, you have an inquiry, comment on this, please proceed. I do, I was gonna let us get through the book, but just as we'll bring it up now. Can you tell me how much TANF dollars we bring in as a state? Yeah, we get around 216 million. We do have a spend plan, let me pull it up. But we carry that funding over, so TANF doesn't have sort of like an expiration date on your block grant, so you can carry it over indefinitely. Do-do-do, let me get all my papers. They're coming to you.",FALSE,,
63,"That's not the end question, I have. So we get about $216 million a year in TANF, 216.3 million. This year, going into 2025, we had carryover dollars around 64 million. We are projected, assuming we spend most dollars and our projected lapse follows through to what we project, we'll carry over around 36 million, so we'll have 252 million at the beginning of the FY26 for this next year. Okay, with the TANF dollars comes an audit. You are audited annually, or you audited, how often are you audited to look at those TANF dollars? So we get audited kind of on a couple different ways. A state auditor's office looks at TANF every three years. But also at the federal level, they from time to time, yeah, yeah, ACF, they will periodically look at these dollars. When they're looking at that, and this is gonna go back to Representative Christensen's ask of you earlier, but I'm looking at all these programs, and as you're going through them, I'm thinking to myself, who is overseeing these programs to see that they're doing what they're intended to do? So is that on you, or does that happen during the audit process? That's on us. So kind of how we start this, if it's a brand new program, they send us in a program proposal, we look that over, we determine if it meets one of the TANF purposes, right, and it's like, you can prove it meets that TANF purpose. Then they submit a budget, and they submit a budget narrative. And then at that point, their expenditures, as they invoice us in, right, has to stay in line with their budget and budget narrative, and their budget narrative will have all of the details as far as what's happening in the program. We also require that they put outcomes in their proposal to us on what they plan to do with it, so they're gonna serve 57 people, or whatever they're gonna do. So we maintain all of that information. I'll be honest, on the one-time programs that don't get refunded, it's not like that they're gonna necessarily get a full program monitoring, right? But we're going to make sure their expenditures are correct and that it all aligns. You're looking at how they're spending it, and are they spending it the way they said they were going to, or to meet the guidelines? But I wanna know who is overseeing the, seems like the hundreds of different programs, that those programs are effective, and that we're getting our bang for our buck. Even if it's not general revenue, the federal dollars are my dollars as well, our dollars. So is there anyone who's looking at that and auditing the end result to see if we're getting the bang for the buck? So I think it depends on which program you're after, but every program that's- All of them. Okay, so every program that we have, there's four outcomes that have measures with them, and they're gonna depend on what the program is. Is it number of students who have done X, Y, and Z? Or is it number of people that have received domestic violence services? Or is it increased wages because of employment and training? So my staff are, the ones I've talked about, my staff are overseeing those programs. I have a team that does programmatic monitoring, I have a team that does data. And we require reports from participants, and I'm happy to provide you anything and everything that you want, because we do have that on all of our programs. No, I think I just wanna know that there's somebody, someone who's looking at that particular program, whichever one it is, and again, that we're getting results for the millions and millions of dollars that we're spending on that. Right, and we have units that are split. So I have a unit that only does data, I have a unit that does monitoring, I have a unit that does invoicing, I have a unit that does training. So they're each responsible for their respective piece. They pull random cases if we notice trends and things like that. No, very good, I appreciate it. And like I said, I believe you're gonna follow up with the reps, and if you would just, if you wanna make that available to all of us, that'd be great. So thank you, Mr. Chair. I think I have one left, sorry. Trying to hurry. Okay, page 860 is services for victims of sexual assault. This goes to 61 Domestic Violence Shelters and Resource Centers, and it has professional services include professional therapy, crisis intervention, case management, support group, 24-hour hotline, and medical and legal advocacy. Representative Martin, you have an inquiry, you may proceed.",TRUE,"I have a team that does programmatic monitoring, I have a team that does data.",
64,"Yeah, just another follow-up question, Representative Taylor. So groups who have the other core outcomes, things like that, are there organizations that then are disqualified throughout the year, they're not getting in their information, and then they're not up for renewal, things like that, and so are there, is there information available? We funded 100 last year, but six of them didn't qualify anymore, they didn't do this, this, and this, I'm just curious on that. So we have some projects that are one-times that actually never get implemented, because they don't give us the information that we need to prove that they are TANF eligible or otherwise, right? Or if they just refuse to give us a proposal, I mean, it's a process to even get the money. There's a whole process involved in it. They have to be a non-profit, all of that. As far as disqualifying them, I think it depends on what it is, right, if it's a project that's put in through the General Assembly process, as long as they're doing the outcomes, right, we're not gonna do that. Now, some of our employment training programs, we do move funds around based on need. So those we have a little bit more leverage on, but the one-time ones, as long as they've done everything they said they were gonna do, and they get us what they're supposed to, yeah. Thank you, I think we're ready for Children's Division. Thank you. Should we, I think everybody else is generally able to come and go as they please. Mr. Lubring, would it help you if we took five minutes? Are you okay to keep going? Okay, if that changes, I understand, just let us know, and until or unless, we'll keep going. Thank you. No, I'm good with keep going, I wouldn't wanna miss the 10.30 deadline that somebody put on me. I had his number, too, so there's a little bit of personal satisfaction, yeah. All right, so next we are going to book five of eight. I have here with me Kayla Uelger, the acting director for Children's Division, I'll let her introduce herself and a little bit about her, but since she's only had two or three months here, I will go through the budget books and she will provide you the programmatic color. Good evening, it's almost good morning again, you guys. Pleasure to be here this evening, Kayla Uelger, I've been with the department for 12 years, I've been acting director of Children's Division since November the 2nd, 108 days, no one's counting, I'm counting, and I'm glad to be here to walk through this with you, thank you. All right, so we will start, like I said, book five of eight, the first tab is the child welfare cost to continue on page 866. We did have a supplemental in child welfare for both adoption subsidy and the QRTP. For the cost to continue, the QRTP, we are handling that through a core switch that we can talk about later on when we get to the QRTP between the IMD and non-IMD and I'll provide a little bit more highlight around that piece later on. This is the cost to continue for the adoption subsidy and subsized guardianship. Those programs continue to grow, this year, even though we originally asked for a supplemental, it wasn't needed due to flex, but as those programs continue to grow for adoption subsidy and subsidized guardianship, we're anticipating, again, needing additional funding for those programs next year. Next tab is page 870, this is children's administration. It is 7.3 million total, 75 staff, and 3.6 million GR. These are our central office staff that do around policy, training, field support, and some of the E&E in here is also used to support statewide field activities that are coordinated at central office. So even though the E&E looks a little bit higher here, a lot of that is just due to the fact that some of this statewide coordination for field offices. Next section is page 878, and this is the child abuse and neglect hotline, so these are the staff that take in the calls, so whenever child abuse and neglect is reported, these are the actual staff that sit in on the hotline to take the call and then refer it out to field. Page 884.Is the a new decision item for the can you this is 10 additional staff? Uh, they did some um they did an assessment of the the Child abuse and neglect operations in in 2024 and I think late 2023 to look at you know What do we need to do to do our job? um, and so there was an Recommendation for additional staff and so the governor appropriated 10 additional staff that way we can get the hotlines answered quicker And better information out to the field to support that agency So on this can you help us understand like what does 10 people and 700 000 get us, uh in you know is it just answering calls that are people having to call back or the Wait times decreased or like just if you could provide some additional insight as to exactly What this does to help the situation sure Uh, this unit is responsible for taking all of the calls coming into the entire state through the the front end of the of the Work, so they are responsible for screening in all of the hotlines that come in And in fiscal year 23, they took 140 000 nearly 140 000 calls And we screened in about 61 000 of those served about 86 000 kids so The work that was done in 23 and 24 was specific with andrew reese with call centers to improve our customer service Handling time. So our average weight time in 24 was about four and a half minutes and a handle time of 20 minutes So we think the additional 10 Although we requested 25 and grateful for the 10 Will help us to improve that handle time and then getting it out to the field to support field distribution. So not the If I understood you correctly not the four minutes but The four minutes and the 20 minutes handle time. Okay, so both both Yeah And the distribution when you think about how we put it out to the field and getting those things out to the workers who are Actually doing the hotlines, um, it supports that work as well. Thank you representative. Uh lewis you have something on this. Please proceed yeah, I think I want to I I you know that I would you say 140 000 calls 139. Yeah, well 739. Yep and Correct me if i'm wrong, but there is a federal hotline That you can also call for these type of things, but if you do call the federal hotline Unless I'm not aware of a federal hotline and All of those hotlines for the state come through that central central hotline unit for children's division so all of the ones that would be for abuse and for neglect or for sexual exploitation or Any of those things so there is there's a national sex trafficking like sexual exploitation hotline if that's what you're referencing But these would be specific to abuse neglect within the state of missouri generally speaking when people call in they don't It's not like oh, this is a exploitation. This is abuse. It's they're going to call Whichever hotline number they see The problem is when they call the federal hotline. We don't get anything back for about a month It's a long long turnaround And so this this is the only hotline that serves Missouri residents and it's the only one that gets Relatively instant results. I mean instant is not the right word, but quick results And I think that's that's important for us to realize when we're funding this That yeah people call on the federal hotline and they think they've done something and yet It's a long turnaround before that number gets back Anything from and sometimes never gets back to the state about well, there's an instance of of You know sex trafficking You know, yeah, you can call it abuse. You can call it sex trafficking. It's still sexual abuse and if you call the federal line, it's It might be weeks before you ever get a contact back to the state and no response because it there's no good mechanism and so the state line is the Line that we need to promote and we do need the people to fund it or to staff it so I appreciate it. I just that was what I was trying to point out because I've done a little bit with this.",FALSE,,
65,"I appreciate that. Yep So where would these staff be Within the can who unit they're statewide. So they're they're in different offices, but they report to a statewide system Okay, so this is not all in one place it's There is two main locations of some of those staff in kansas city and jefferson city And then there's a few other locations because of where they're we're hiring them. But yes, they're um, they're around the state so they're on page 886 there's um 48,300 for lease building lease payments So would that be one building and one lease like an expansion or is this to spread out across or is this just a Cost allocation of existing lease space or just clue me into what i'm looking at Normally, we'll ask for additional lease space for these staff. So depending it would depend on where we add them to so it could be we need to add space here in jeff city or If we're moving out state wherever we would need state, uh to add Lease cost to place. So it has not yet been identified.",FALSE,,
66,"No, okay. Very good. All right. Thank you All right, uh, the next section is page 888 This is the children's field staff and operations. Uh, so this is the funding for all of our field offices all the circuit Uh offices throughout the state. These are the staff that do the child abuse and neglect investigations They do the case management piece Uh, these are the supervisors and administrative support that support those staff and the very important work they do throughout the state And it's 111 million Uh, 11.5 million 48.6 million gr 1784.86 staff. Can you explain a little bit more on page 890 the last part there? Uh, This was a 19 million 125 thousand dollar increase from the previous year this project the project has not resulted in a finalized Contract causing the lapse I think in reference to the 21 million in fy24 So last year there was uh, the foster care module, uh that got it added to this section um, and that has not been finalized so if you look at the Uh 19.1 million dollars federal in that section a lot of that is due to that lapse of that that one-time module And that was a crossover with mhd, I believe So what's the status of that then? So the mo health net department has their own funding so they're moving forward with their internal funding on that at this point Thank you Okay, and so Let's see here. We so that was core reduced in 25 And that was the reason for the lapse and so that's all Squared away then. Yep. Okay, so That went forward and has that then been implemented is or is mhd still working on that? Do we know or I guess that's I think they're still working on we can get you a status to that project Very good. Thank you. Please proceed Next section on page Or 899 um is staff training a new decision item, so these are three additional staff on for the um, Children's division field. So as I discussed earlier in the day, we're talking about the high turnover rates We were underneath sort of a performance improvement plan Uh, one of the things identified is we got reviewed by the feds and other people is that our training curriculum isn't Quite up to snuff because we keep turning staff over It is important to get those staff You know handling cases as quickly and as effectively as possible in order to do that We need additional staff to do effective training for this staff because it was found that you know We we weren't getting those workers trained well enough in the past and so with these additional three staff that will help the statewide training and and Help hopefully lower that turnover rate, but even with the higher turnover rate help those uh staff be more effective at their jobs You know on this new staff and I don't know what I feel like we probably already passed the core item and I don't know where I should have directed it or where it would have been maybe just staff and operations, but we the um the prevention staff that we added which I think this ndi kind of alludes to on Page 900 about the you know support received but What's the status on on that? Can you speak to that? Because that was a pretty significant fte increase Uh Is that if we generally realized is that we've been staffed up in that regard? Yeah, we we've got most of those hired I think 97 of the 100 you're talking about the 100 prevention staff and those will be uh later on in the section You'll see Some of those broken out so we can kind of highlight those when we get there on the family centered services staff the team decision making um Do what? And the prevention staff, um, so yeah, those are Mostly hired and and working out there Okay very good and Are there any additional questions? Are there any questions on this ndi specifically? Okay.",FALSE,,
67,Thank you.,FALSE,,
68,"You may proceed All right. Next section is the health information specialist six staff in four and seventy eight thousand dollars These staff were hired and added due to the psychotropic drug uh Lawsuit that we had a couple years ago and some additional duties that our staff throughout the Field have to track and help manage these when we have children in custody that have certain Uh medicines prescribed to them and make sure those cases are being managed effectively Right now that kind of falls throughout the state. This would help us get six Uh six staff that would be selected just to do this job and take someof that work off the field staff. On page 904 in box 4 there it says CD is requesting FTE to hire additional health information specialists. How many health information specialists, how many FTE do we currently have within CD? Do you know that? I do not know off the top of my head but I can get back with you on that. Okay, we'd be curious to know what that number is and then what the vacancy rate is at present and to the extent there are any vacancies? I mean one is, again, I just don't know how many, what the universe we're looking at, but to the extent there really was any vacancies and I don't know if there is or isn't, but to the extent there was, you know, and again I'm really speculating at this point, but if it happened that there were, what's the rationale or the belief that, you know, we would be able to hire and recruit additional people if we have vacancies? So, but again, that's a theoretical question. Yeah, and we can go back and see if there's any vacancies in there. You know, they are doing a better job at hiring and so thankfully the General Assembly, as they have raised the salaries for these individuals across, you know, the workers, so we can take a look at that, you know, but our hope is at some point we can effectively fill all of our positions and reduce turnover. You know, which it hasn't been adopted yet, I don't know what the General Assembly will do as it relates to the pay plan that has been recommended by the Governor, but on that, I don't, it's been, seems like it was days ago, but I believe it was just some hours, you know, before session we were talking about the pay plan. There was that 1% piece, you know, additional to Children's Division. I don't, I believe I asked the question, forgive me if I did, but how did we arrive at that 1%? I mean, well, and I realized that this, no, you didn't come from the Department, but do you have any insight into that? I mean, why 1%? Why not a half of a percent? Why not 5%? Why not 3%? Why, I mean, why, why 1%? I would have to get back with you on it and see what the rationale. You're not aware of the methodology? No.",TRUE,Next section is the health information specialist six staff in four and seventy eight thousand dollars,
69,"To the extent there is any, and I'm just curious. I mean, we did, you know, we had been looking at trying to raise the salaries for workers across the board in Children's Division. There has been a focus on, you know, trying to get them more in line with, you know, what other states are. We're still quite a bit below. I hear you. Look, we've been trying that for years over here. Rationale 1 versus 5 or versus 10. I would have to get back with you on that.",FALSE,,
70,"Yeah. Okay, just curious if there, I mean, I understand at some point we're just trying to help where we feel like we need it, and so maybe that's just what the belief was, that there was ability to do at this time, but to the extent there is any, you know, method to the madness there. Just to loop back with you on the health information specialist team, they have 12 on the team currently with no vacancies, and so the additional request was because of the workload to improve and in those outcomes on that psych med settlement to continue to improve what we're doing in that space. Thank you.",FALSE,,
71,"Appreciate the follow-up. All right, next page on page 907 is the Bachelors of Social Work program, $308,000, 77,000 GR, 231,000 federal. This would be a tuition assistance program for both current staff that may be administrative assistants, the care aides, we have a, what do they call them? Case aides. Case aides, I'm sorry, throughout the state, so they're not quite to the level of a social worker. However, they are interested in this field of work. What they lack is maybe the actual degree, and so this would be a tuition assistance program to sort of assist those current case aides into making that next step, and then, you know, to a certain degree, even beyond that, if we can entice people to come in, start as case aides, and then get the tuition assistance to have a pipeline for social workers due to the high turnover, and then we're also enticing people that actually want to do the work into the division. Is there any additional eligibility criteria, or would there be beyond just that job class, to the extent, I guess, someone could get? No, it could be any job class. It's not going to be just case aides, but I think, you know, that's just the one we come to mind, that individuals that we know have a desire for that type of work, but it could, yeah, it wouldn't be any. So it's not even job class specific, it could be anybody that, I guess, could get into a program at an accredited university. Is there a, and you have kind of, there's limited tuition expenses and stipends, and you know, so that's delineated here. So to the extent the funding was available, and someone could qualify, they'd be eligible within the children's division. Yes, and social work, psychology, justice system, sociology, education, so the idea was to attract those, and we take a lot of interns into that space, and so really thinking about how we're recruiting those college interns with this tuition assistance, and then having a payback option on that. So it's really to recruit and retain, to take your case aides and move them into a different space, but also to look at your college students that are in those, some of those spaces, and then bring them into the division. Interns would be eligible? That's my understanding when in the review of the program. Okay, and then you've got the majority of this funding coming out of 610. Is that, is that a sustainable funding source, or would this be a GRP? Our goal here is to get the 4E training, the enhanced match for this program, which is $25.75. So our goal would be to try to get the enhanced 4E. All right, so you think the feds could potentially support this on an ongoing basis, your beliefs? All right, as long as we get, you know, we have to get their approval and meet all the criteria, but what happens if they don't approve it, we just don't do it? We'd have to, you'd probably get less, it'd be a 50-50 program versus a 75-25. Are there any other states doing this, to your knowledge, or? A lot of states that do BSW programs like this, and we have, currently have an MSW program, and actually the state of Missouri did a similar program, a BSW program, years prior, and then our landscape changed, and so we no longer supported the BSW program and moved only to the MSW. So this is really bringing back something we've done previously.",FALSE,,
72,"Thank you. All right, next line is a new decision item to expand the CARE portal. So the CARE portal is, it's a platform that basically, it helps connect a lot of our foster parents and connects them with some local resources, with churches, local entities, community partnerships, to help match those individuals up with the services that may be available locally to help them out. Right now it's, I think it's $500,000, this would take it to $750,000.",TRUE,"All right, next line is a new decision item to expand the CARE portal.

73,"All right, the next section are staff for diligent search. This is 24 staff, $1.26 million dollars, $900,000 GR. This came out of Senate Bill 186, it was first funded in FY25, so these staff do specific duties to help do diligent search for relative kinship placements for those kids as soon as they come in custody, and to do that quickly and effectively. Next section is page 918, 20 staff for family-centered services staff. 20 staff, $3.6 million dollars, 2.8 GR. So these are staff that work with, as it talks about, family-centered services, so if a kid, they become involved, they have some issues, we get a hotline on them. If they're at risk of coming into CARE, one of the tools we have is to provide family-centered services, so these staff work with the family, do outreach, make sure those cases are, you know, they're mentoring the parents, providing preventative services, connecting them with local supports to help keep that child safe in their home and not coming into custody of the division. Next is page 925, team decision-making. Representative Mayhew, you have a question on this item, you may proceed. Thank you, Mr. Chair. So I've become aware of more than a couple of cases where we probably didn't follow that or the model that we're getting ready to talk about on 925, and I really want to talk to somebody about this issue, and so I'd love it if somebody would come by my office. I'd love to come have a conversation with you. I would really appreciate that because did I just happen to come across the two cases in the entire state of Missouri where we didn't follow our own rules? Maybe, I would, but I need to hear some more information before I can make the determination. And I would love to, because if this, I'm hoping it's an exception, but if it's the rule, we've got a real problem. We're putting a lot of effort into areas where none is required, and you know, when we look at this budget, it's, I mean, a hundred and eleven million dollars, and I hope that a bunch of that isn't wasted by duplication of effort and unnecessary processes put on on folks. So if you don't mind, if next couple of days hopefully, if the weather holds, that we could get somebody to chat with me about that. Absolutely, sir. Thank you, thank you, Mr. Chair. The next section, page 925, is team decision-making. 20 staff, 3.6 million, 2.8 GR. These staff specialize in helping coordinate the team decision-making model. These are where we bring in multiple different individuals and agencies that are involved with the case to makeone team decision-making and the best choice for the kid. Yeah and this is these last three have been part of that hundred so you got the 20 the 2020. All right all right next page is the FACES replacement page 932 are the CWIS which is the the federal name the Comprehensive Child Welfare Information System is the federal name FACES is our current systems name this is the the FACES is our current case management system for child welfare. We are looking at replacing that system this is 7.3 million dollars for the replacement of that system it's coming from the budget stabilization fund and 610 fund the budget stabilization fund would be the match and so this is ongoing for looking at this program in the future we are making taking a step back and making sure we're taking the right approach with the RFP and following making sure we're making good decisions on this. So I thought we were going like for COTS type product originally is that still not the case or I think and I don't know where it's gonna end up we've been looking at doing an RFP and a COTS and things like that I think with the new director okay so with the COTS for CWIS we have a couple of different options but the ones that are running in other states or have been implemented don't have federal there's like two and they don't have kind of the federal stamp of approval yet except for the ones that were built in-house so the COTS solutions to this aren't are in like a very early stages where if you see like a COTS solution on home and community-based services case management we have those that have been established for decades and running so that's something where we want to look at what are the other options what states we don't want to be a guinea pig state for a COTS solution to be approved by Child and Family Services federal level so what does that mean effectively as in like are we worried about the the IT solution itself and its applicability or its usability or we worried about the federal match participation or both both both okay well yeah I don't that sounds terrible if it's we're not confident on either one of those Minnesota implemented a Medicaid as I think it's Minnesota I don't want to talk about about another state and it'd be the wrong state but it's not like it's a person so but the a state implemented their Medicaid case management system and it never got certified through Medicaid so they're playing 100% GR instead of the 90-10 well don't do that representative Voss you proceed please thank you I was just inquiring around who's leading this is this an ITSD led review or implementation or is this within the department all of the IT projects are joined so we will have a it will be a actual OA contract at the time but we our staff have been working together there's an IT project manager and then there is a point of contact lead at the Social Services Department and Children's Division ultimately I think when you're implementing a project like this it always comes back to the department who owns the system who has really the responsibility IT is our support away IT is our support in implementing and they have a lead but we have the ultimate responsibility so does that mean that DSS will be signing off on each of the program gates to include that we've mapped all of our work processes that we have all the user tests and system tests all identified and authorizing payment to any vendor that we select that would be correct so we make those when in any IT project we develop those milestones that they have to meet in terms of user accepts and user acceptance testing why can't I say that right now you wait for our UAT training it's it's past that time and any of the other deliverables around that and then that is something the department signs off on ultimately away can review that but we would send payment out only after that milestone has been demonstrated got it yeah we just we can improve our hit rate as a state on some of our IT system improvements and I think it's really important that we collaborate together I think we've got some good teammates over at ITSD but want to make sure that we're leveraging their knowledge and experience because we've got a recent example on our childcare payment system that well we could have done a lot better I think I just want to make sure that something as large as our Medicaid program that we're not paying all GR because we had too much pride in our departments in our ITSD group and one of the things I'll talk about is just the reality of something I talked about the beginning very briefly and that I wanted to take a step back on larger IT projects when you have the consolidation of oh a IT a decade ago I want to belabor this point because it is very late and what you had was departments had to create their own project management teams internally in order to make sure this goes well some have had more flexibility and in time to do that over the years some have not so you'll see it like mental health is a little bit further along but it social services we need a little bit more IT internal infrastructure to support this thank you mr. chair what is the new timeline or is there one or is it indeterminate at this period in time because I think if we were I don't remember what it was but I feel like a year or two years ago when we first you know we're talking about this you know like what you're saying now and I'm not saying like it sounds like this probably best course of action but I don't think then it was said that where you are today is where we would be that makes sense yeah that's fair we you know I think back then a couple different directions were taking taken with this and we thought we'd be further along but we you know because there's been different options thrown out and so I think in looking at it I don't know if I can give you a timeline today on where we'll be because a lot it depends on on what options and in what kind of approach we take with this whether it be an RFP or NASBA or things like that I think originally when we talked to you I think there was some idea that was from COTS but I think as they got down some of those paths they realized okay this maybe isn't the right path and then they backed out and tried a different path and and I think we've tried a couple different paths that haven't panned out for us okay well just when you get a little bit more clarity around that I don't know if that's two months from now during the interim but you know follow-up yeah you know certainly be appreciated and obviously I know this is you know I think we've been sold on the importance over time which is why we've you know appropriated the money but it's clearly your people in the field and from my understanding faces leaves a lot to be desired so I'm sure you all are would like to find a good solution that addresses the needs of the division and you know it's not for lack of desire on your part so a little more clarity around that yeah any update would be appreciated and with that we can continue all right the next section is page 937 this children's division staff training so these are the E&E dollars that we use for transportation training curriculum in actual training in some places contractual or E&E dollars for the training for our children's division staff the next section is page 942 and this is the children's staff training special investigations this is five hundred and

underneath families first that would be eligible for 5050 funding for the feds most prevention money before family first was a hundred percent GR so state-only funds the feds weren't participating in prevention activities the family first legislation changed that but it's got to meet a lot of differentcriteria including be proven out to fidelity.

74,It's two million dollars. Currently we still haven't implemented this program. We're trying to find providers. We're looking at putting some drafts out there by the middle of March and and have a service provider draft completed by hopefully April sometime. But one of the difficulties here is meeting fidelity and getting providers that can basically for lack of better words jump through all the hoops needed to meet the federal requirements. Representative Mayhew you have an inquiry you may proceed. Yes so but I mean we've been we've been appropriating for this for three years now and so we what's what's been holding us up on that. We can't come up with an RFP or what what's what are we doing? We can the RFP is not necessarily the problem. The fidelity monitoring and the requirements to have these therapies and have the service providers that are able to to do those pieces has been part of the concern and a lot of that groundwork has been laid and I think we're in a space to move this forward. But there have been some concerns previously I think with some of the service providers. So these aren't our normal compass health and people like that to do this kind of stuff? No so the the brief strategic family therapy and the parent-child interaction therapy which is the next I think line item sorry but both of them were specific therapies that are put into the the plan. However the fidelity monitoring and some of the requirements say that you can only be certified in those therapies and so then when you get into some of our service providers they're certified in a lot of therapies. Hang on a second. Sorry. You can only be certified in that one specific thing? Some of these have those types of requirements on them yes and that's part of the family first all a lot of the a lot of the programming within the hoops with the federal pieces have a lot of requirements that make it very difficult to provide the find the providers that can meet the requirements. So yet another bureaucratic mass created by the federal government writing that I'm certain that the federal statute didn't contemplate that particular situation that had to be a federal bureaucrat writing a rule of their interpretation of the statute. Speculation on my part you don't have to speculate. So what does that mean that we have to then go find only that one individual in the entire country who has that one certification? So we would partner with the model purveyors so they own basically the rights to these therapies and help provide the training to people who are willing to become the service providers for those things. Not all therapies have those requirements but many of them have those requirements because now listen my clinical social worker nerds gonna kick right in guys because if I'm trying to show fidelity to a particular model I have to say that I'm only doing that thing and if I'm doing multiple things it may look like I'm not I'm not a purist to that model and so the feds have really strict requirements on having those things available and being able to say yes I'm only doing this model and yes we got this outcome. So it's a really outcome driven kind of mindset. Assumes that only that particular model will work. Correct. Based off of the outcomes driven from those models and those are based off the title for a clearinghouse if you guys are interested in some light reading go you can do it tonight when you're done I'm sure you'll have all the energy to do it. Well it sounds to me like it's a bureaucratic monopoly created to drive the price of whatever that is up. And maybe that's so but there there are some ways to move this forward there are some there are some ways to do this there's been a lot of hoops to get to where we are right now. Well I think I'm calling Elon Musk on this one. Thank you thank you Mr.,FALSE,,
75,"Chair. Are there states that we're aware of that have had success you know that have kind of broken through because and we'll get to the you know the generalized grant here in a minute obviously a few tabs away but you know we've had virtually no expenditures and every year I mean it's like Groundhog Day and again I'm not casting aspersions I don't know I'm not suggesting for one moment it's for lack of desire trying on the department's part but it's like well we think this will be the year we're hoping that it you know and and I mean what you just said frankly again with all due respect and I'm not suggesting that it's in any way the fault of anybody within CD or DSS but it I mean it was probably something very similar said by somebody last year and the year before that so I mean is anybody having success I mean is there somebody we can look to that's kind of figured it out and not have to reinvent the wheel or is everybody right where we are? A lot of states are right where we are there are some states that have moved forward with certain pieces of this and exploring other options and one of those things and I will eventually get to there get to it we've partnered with Chapin Hall who's national consultant to help us move forward but they've been on the groundwork of this so there's a few states that are making headway here but there's a lot of states in a similar space as us they've figured out that this has been difficult to move forward. Yeah and I don't maybe I don't know if this is what Representative Mahe was suggesting or not but I mean and again this is outside of our control but maybe it's at some point the federal government to the extent where we're gonna maybe they set the bar just a little bit too high great to have you know high expectations and standards and whatnot but I mean it almost seems unattainable at this point because again I appreciate that you all are trying I have no confidence that this is you know that we'll be back here and see any expenditures on this item next year so I hope I'm wrong but it has been you know just year after year and same same result and again I know not because of lack of desire trying on on the part of the department but it just it is what it is so anyway please proceed right the next section on page 968 is the parent-child interact therapy again it's 1.9 million similar to what their previous on the brief strategic therapy this is part of one of the ones on the clearinghouse that's identified that can receive 50 50 percent funding however again due to the things we just talked about has been difficult to get off the ground next section this is the birth match program this is six hundred and sixty one thousand dollars of TANF so house bills 429 432 establish the birth match program basically what this is is a birth match between our data on individuals that have had apparent rights terminated who then have a another child within Department of Health and Senior Services so there is a referral over to us and we will do a health and wellness visited visit with that individual this section funds staff to help do that statewide although it's you know not necessarily just to staff that do this it might be the local staff but also provides these services and wraparound services that they may need when they do that child visit representative may he you may proceed yes but we've never done it there's a zero expended funds so one of the difficult things we've had with this program is there have been do we know how many kids we've done around 250 in the past a lot of this money has been tied up in different sections so if they do the visit itself and no wraparound services are needed then there's no expenditures so what it's it's late I apologize what what is the need for this why why do we even need this program well it's in statute so in the program itself is something we're required to do by statute if you're talking about the dollars yeah I mean they're there in case we would need something like that wraparound services so what would be a wraparound service and you know I hate getting too far into the weeds but give me an example of something other than the visit that we're talking about that that that would be employed here it might be in I do not know what all not being a social worker what all different services may need be required by these but it may need be things like mentoring counseling similar to our treatment type services which we apparently have not felt the need to do on any of them for the last three years okay and now these the money that's that's appropriated for this is just it has to be appropriated for that specific thing it looks like it's just coming out of TANF this was line itemed yes it's TANF this funding could be used for any other thing but this line item it can only be used for the birth match program right so and we have passed a statute that required this program to require the birth match program right and to the degree we have expenditures we'd pull them out of this line okay thank you all right next section page 978 is children's treatment services 25.5 million total 15.2 million GR and 10.2 million federal so these would be as kids come in into care this would be traditional CTS services including mental health assistancebehavioral health services, family therapy, group therapy, individual therapy, parent aids, etc. Also in this section we have a contract for intensive in-home services. I believe off top my head that's around 12 or 13 million dollars. What they do is if a child is at risk, the contractor provides intensive in-home services and family unit to help keep that child in the home and keep them from coming into care. Next section, page 984, these are crisis care. Crisis care agencies provide support via contract to kids who are in parents. So the parents have a crisis going on as it says or needs a safe place for that kid to go for eight hours a day, a couple days, until they resolve whatever situation is going on, whether it be a domestic violence situation, legal situation, anything where there's a risk to the child, they can bring them to these agencies, drop it out, take care of that, and then come back and pick up the kids. These go to like the Joplin area Children's Haven, Kansas City area Synergy, Annie Malone, Springfield area, Isabelle's house, etc. Representative Boggs, you have an inquiry, you may proceed. Yeah, Mehue may not want to get in the weeds, but chiggers, there's no chiggers right now, it's cold. So 973, maybe this is where Mehue was going with this, this is kind of question I have. So I see F2, FTEs, if I can still say that at this hour, and so maybe that would help maybe explain to us what, where the FTEs are, if they're just not filled positions, or if that's just two FTEs that would happen to play in. So they're not two specific FTEs that do the birth match, so what we'd have to do for these staff is try to identify when these staff go out to these 250. So if you think about it, we don't have two staff going out all 250, it's a local person doing that, and to date we haven't figured out a way to allocate that time back to this section. So if you have, this might be 250 staff statewide that have done one each visit. It equates to basically two FTE, but we haven't figured out a way yet to basically track those staff's time and bill it to this section. Okay, I think I understand that.",FALSE,,
76,"So let's, let's move on. Sorry to backtrack, but I just saw that and thought maybe that would work into the explanation. But, and also the services are in here there too, so there's two different pieces in there. Okay, so that's probably what it is. So thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 989. 989, this was added last year for court ordered drug testing. We're still getting off the ground and identifying some of these, but this provides and pays for drug testing whenever, for parents that were involved with, whenever the court orders it. Next is the Family First section. This is zeroed out, it gets added as one time. It is the transition dollars that we just talked about, and we can talk about the NDI later on. This was broken out into five different sections, and we can kind of run through each one of those. We originally received ten million dollars, it's got to be liquidated by 12, 29, 25. We still have around six million dollars remaining of these funds. If you look at, through the different sections, there was community setting grants set up for these individuals that, you know, there was some expenditures there, not a lot. FVPSA community setting contracts, things that were appropriated over the years, and there we spent $325,000 in FY 24 development startup prevention programs around figuring out ways to get providers to set up some of these prevention programs, like the ones we are just talking about, where they have to meet fidelity. But again, we've been having a difficult time finding providers to meet all that different difficult federal requirements around these to get these set up. We did have $569,000 around there to try to help set some of these programs up. Foster Care Res Treatment, and there were some grants to providers to help them meet some of the Family First prevention acts, and again that is zeroed out. The new decision item page on 1024 is to basically continue that funding into FY 26, which will be the last year you see that. We do have a current spend plan around the Family First item, if I can find it back, that talks about sort of the community settings grants, kind of where we're at with those development startup prevention programs. We are working with, like they said, Chape and Hall to design and integration and motivation interviewing into their practice, and I don't know if you want to talk about that one. No, okay.",FALSE,,
77,Thanks. So there's all these different ideals that we have that we're going to try to get implemented by December. Sounds great.,FALSE,,
78,"Wish you the best. I mean, you know, my frustration continues with, and again, maybe I need to fly to Washington and talk to my member of Congress, but you know, I mean, we, and again, it's hardly been troublesome to me, although I've spent countless hours over the past seven years thinking, talking about Families First. We've had subcommittee hearings when I chaired the subcommittee for 1011, and we've, you know, had budget machinations, and it's like totally turned on the head, turned on its head, you know, how we do res treatment, obviously. It's, you know, incurred more cost of state because the federal government wants to, and sounds great, right? Like we want to do more prevention, and so they'll help us pay for that, but they're not gonna help us pay for institutionalization. I get all things equal. That's not great, but then they really won't help us pay for prevention, you know, and because at least that's not been our experience. We hadn't figured out how to make it work, so it's really incredibly frustrating, but, and again, my frustration is not at the two of you or anybody at the department, but boy, this just has never worked, and I hope one day it will, but it's, it sure hasn't yet, and the sad thing is, like, there's real people behind these numbers, and I don't know that we're doing any better by anybody, and certainly, again, I, it's laudable and admirable that we would focus more on prevention, and it just, you know, maybe one day we'll realize it, but we've got a long ways to go, so I sure hope our federal partners will partner with us at some point and make this work, because I feel like you all, and there's been support from the General Assembly, we've sure, I feel like, done our part. No, I agree with your frustration. It has been difficult because they said they would fund prevention, but only if you do it certain ways and exactly their way. Yeah, which seems, you know, almost to be an impossibility, but anyway, we can, I digress, we go on, but, you know, there's no reason to, so let's move on till next year.",FALSE,,
79,"Thank you. Next section is the foster care section, so this is not the foster care maintenance, these are special expenses for children placed in foster care, so these are things like transportation, some attorney fees, fingerprinting, and some behavioral health services for these kids placed in foster care. Again, not the maintenance, these are the special needs section. The next section is page 1035, this is a foster care outdoor program. You will see there has been lapses in the past, we have, we're on pace to spend a bunch of this money. There were some issues around this program a couple years back, we had some house bill languaged, we've gotten that all worked out with a provider and I think with the General Assembly, and have moved forward this last year. Next section, that is where your maintenance payments come in, so this is 99.7 million dollars, 51.5 million GR, so these are the actual maintenance payments for the kids placed in care. If you go out to our program description book, they do kind of lay out some of our maintenance rates on page 590 of the program description books and kind of lay out what our current rates, so for example, age zero to five traditional foster care after licensure is five hundred nine dollars, six through twelve is five hundred seventy seven, ages 13 and older 712, different rates for whether it's level A medical and foster care, level B foster care, or emergency foster care. Next section is a therapeutic foster care placement, 6.5 million dollars total, 4.5 million GR, 1.9 million federal, so this program is for therapeutic foster care, the ideal around this is these are higher level kids, in order to step them down out of res treatment, you need basically a placement that is dedicated to just taking care of this kid, so these aren't just your typical foster parents that I do have a job during the day, have daycare for the child, these are therapeutic foster parents that their whole job is that kid. Representative Mayhew, you may proceed. Starting to sound like a broken record, apologize for that, but this has significant lapse also, is it that, so why do we need such a big appropriation if we're gonna lapse half of it? This program actually started in 2023, so there was some startup, we did have to do a study, because we used to have a therapeutic foster care program, but it was pretty lower level, the rate wasn't there to really incentivize somebody that just to want to stay home, not have a job, we did develop two different rates around that program to the Friday.Residential treatment, so you'll see in 23 it was nine hundred thirty thousand last year was 2.4 This year we are on pace to spend closer. We spent 1.5 million halfway So we're gonna spend a little over three million dollars the original 6.5 was our original Projection on where we thought we needed to be and as far as Kids that need this type of placement there are the universe of kids out there that needed one of the things is trying to get Providers and develop those providers in there they did some we did look at doing some of that transition money to do with some of these Grants to providers to try to develop these homes We're not quite where we want to be yet We'd like to see it closer to 6.5 But it's based on the providers that we have in the kids that we can place there so but From what you just told me you're gonna lapse half of it again, correct and And Shall we I get you you were just starting out in 23 Is there a problem with finding these folks is is there just not enough of them out there? What was yeah, I mean basically we're asking families to take on up to two kids, and that's all they do right So it's we're trying to provide providers, and we work through our residential treatment providers who use these placements to step them down But Think of how hard it is to find foster parents. This is Multiple steps up from that so we're asking people to dedicate their lives to just taking care of this child So the biggest chunk of this is gr. Yeah, and So if we don't have an expectation that we're gonna Utilize the entire six million, then why wouldn't we back out some of that gr? For Or do you have hopes that you're gonna get to the point where you're gonna spend that we have been pushing the providers and pushing to Try to recruit more therapeutic foster parents, so I mean that would be our goal to get to that level There would be savings to the degree. We can get that level There's savings on the rest treatment side because those placements and rest treatment are a lot more expensive than these placements But only if we can find them correct, okay, thank you mr. Chair I Would just add you know we have a significant number of kiddos boarding in hospitals who are in need of this type of Placement in this type of support, it's very specialized Trauma-informed one-on-one type of support so you have to have a lot of commitment from your provider pool, right? So there is there's a significant need for this As we continue to grow it, and there's a there's a huge opportunity there Representative Houseman you have an inquiry you may proceed Thank You mr. Chair approximately how many kids do we have in the state that would qualify for this I? Will have to get back with you ma'am okay, please do I will I will definitely follow up mr.",FALSE,,
80,"Chair All right, I have it just one moment, please thank you, so I just didn't know that I have it I don't know what time it is I Can't even read that's how many so I have how many we have had it. I don't know how many would qualify, but we have 224 homes that provided care to 309 kids as of January 31st, but that's not the same as the number where that would qualify right so that I will get back With you, that's the currently number currently receiving who've received, but I will get back with you on the number that would qualify You All right next section is QRTP non-imd so the advent of the families first and I'll kind of talk about the next two sections together both the QRTP non-imd and the QRTP imd so QRTP stands for qualified residential treatment program The advent of families first kind of Really changed the way what feds said they would Reimburse us for residential treatment so One is QRTP and order to get and so when you look at res treatment There's two sides of the funding stream here You have the room and by board side which is a 4e and you have the Medicaid side Which is now covered underneath the specialty plan and managed care and so what you're seeing in the this section is a room and board Side so the qualified in order to qualify for residential treatment I mean for 4e you have to be a QRTP so on the room and board side you have to become a QRTP to get that One of the things that's also brought up are the feds sort of Tried to enforce as we're doing families first is what's called an IMD And so that's an institution for medical disease so you can be a qualified residential treatment program That's an also an IMD and you could be a qualified residential treatment program That could be a non IMD you could also be a regular res treatment program Which is a non IMD and IMD so think of your? Sort of our grid on there so it you know again It made it more difficult across the board to get funding for residential treatment So we did set up early on we came to this committee We set up rates for qualified residential treatment programs to help Incentivize these providers to become QRTP so that number one it would meet a lot of the federal standards But theoretically it is a better standard of living so we we kind of incentivize that with new rates along with that We originally tried to decentivize people being IMDs versus non IMDs one of the things we came to find out is So when you're an IMD theoretically if you're over 16 beds There's a lot of different requirements So if you're under 16 beds no matter what you do or what your placement makeup is or how you're situated you're considered a non IMD because in the feds mind if you blow if you blow 16 beds that means a good thing and So basically they even said I don't call bigger providers or worse for service Which I did disagree with on a lot of different levels, but we won't go there Because at the same time a lot of the requirements are putting on you to become a QRTP and a PRTF we require a lot of things like what a 24-hour nurse availability Some psychological or some some medical people on staff You're smaller providers if you're only caring for less than 16 you probably can't afford to have that so you kind of got a band together so long story short We set up new rates, and we set up what was called QRTP IMD and QRTP non IMD We did the original assessment three years ago and sort of then we broke out individuals in two different rates in two different placements last year at about April or May You know what that way and we told the providers once we did that we're going to come back in a year or two Do a new assessment to give them a chance to? Sort of adopt the new federal rules around family first because it all takes us a while to adopt the multiple different rules We did a new one Assessment on the IMD versus non IMD a lot of our providers actually moved from IMD to non IMD What but we did have some providers move from non IMD to IMD Not through any fault of their own, but because of the kids that we were placing with them So one of the things is if you have certain amount of kids that are placed with these providers Just to a mental health diagnosis They become an IMD if they're over 16 beds what that does is disincentivize these providers To say hey, I'm only going to take X amount of kids with a mental health diagnosis Which kind of limits our ability to work with them So we worked with the committee worked with the chair and kind of got that straightened out So long story short We used to have about a 50-50 mix of IMD to non IMD last year. We're able to change that It's about a 75 non IMD to 25 IMD we have a supplemental in the book this year because while we have enough money between the two pots We had not enough in the nine and non IMD pot and too much in the IMD pot This year with this budget what you're going to see is on page 1053. This is a QRT non IMD So they these agencies get for e-funding and Medicaid funding the Medicaid comes from Medicaid side 19.19 million dollars If you look on pages 1055 they started around 13 million dollars on the top of page 1056 we transferred six million dollars in from the non I am from the IMD section to this section to help cover their room and board Because this side increased The next section on page 1058 is the QR TP IMD So these are for eligible providers, but they are not Medicaid eligible And it's around four point eight million dollars And this is just based on the designation of the provider and how many kids we have placed with them You will see on the top of page or on the bottom of page 1060 we started out with about ten point nine million dollars in this section We reduced that down to six point one because that went to the non IMD section taking this four point eight Overall, there's no increase or decrease in dollars here just to the mix between the two Because this is what the feds deem that we have to do basically very good overview of very complex and a lot of moving parts and so well done on that and you might have said it, but If you did I missed it, but just to emphasize the committee I think an important takeaway on that with families first if it's IMD if it's QR TP IMD Then they ain't paying anything and we were in that situation where it was and before we Differentiated the rates. It was full freight GR 100% general revenue No federal support if it's non IMD, then they would participate and so we differentiated that rate that was back when before the reassessment and you had a lot more IMDs and non IMDs as far as the providers and with the with the Reassessments and with you know many moving from IMD to non IMD though you had some move from IMD toor from non-IMD to IMD again because of the placements we were making not because of anything they were doing to your point we were able to consolidate and go back to one rate but because the feds will participate and we had the other thing is and I and you mentioned this but we really increased the rate for non-IMD QRTP when we differentiated it to try to incentivize providers to become non-IMD that's the whole idea and actually we did it for the same or less money because it wasn't full freight general revenue anymore because now the feds are paying and so it was like you know just made all the sense in the world at least in my mind and I think you know had the design you know effect except until we found the unfortunate reality of you know some were gonna go the other direction again not because of anything they were doing but because of what we were doing which kind of put us in a little bit of a you know ticklish situation needless to say but it all works out because we're able to bring the rate back together to one and it still is you know basically budget neutral because now we had so many move from IMD to non-IMD we're getting that federal support where we weren't before so it's all working out in the end still with the higher rate now for everybody is that also seem like a fair I don't know if that made sense to anybody but provide a little more color representative may you representative Taylor we'll go first representative may you okay so the acronyms aside just so I'm have some kind of clarification here QR TP is treatment right for those arrest treatment providers correct yes those are providers who provide some kind of treatment mental health placement yeah yeah they are not just services but they the child is actually placed in that facility yes but in order for them to be an IMD there's some extra special skill or ability that a QR TP would not necessarily have right the QR TP you can be IMD or non-IMD so the non-IMD designation and even outside of QR TPs that designation has been out there but due to families first the feds kind of pushed it really hard with this this new designation so it's intuition for mental diseases and the difference is how that facility is set up and how many kids they have that are have a diet that are in there solely for a mental health diagnosis so they're the big components so the other ones the QR TP is wouldn't I mean treatment program tells me that there's there's some issue that they have that has to be treated right and in that case um and I think here is a mental situation but my I guess my question is is is that the IMDs are a next-level training or capacity or ability beyond the what the QR TPs can do no not really it's it's kind of separate from the QR TP designation so the IMD is considered an institution for mental disease so think of it as kind of two separate tracks if you're you can be a QR TP and an IMD and that basis is sort of a federal concept or construct if you will that basically determines that any facility above 16 beds that has over 50% of the kids placed there solely for a mental health diagnosis right so if you have and a lot of this gets into a lot of stuff where an Eric Martin who is you know a doctor knows way more some so bear with me but and listen to some of the conversations if they're they're due to a trauma or something else that's not a mental health diagnosis and so the mental health diagnosis secondary then and they over 50% of them then you're not an IMD but if you're there solely for a mental health diagnosis so they think you need res treatment not due to trauma but due to mental health diagnosis so one thing just listening to the conversations again I am NOT just like I'm not a lawyer I am NOT a psychiatrist or a doctor a mental or mental health person but it's really hard for them when they look at these to separate a trauma diagnosis from a mental health diagnosis so at a high level I think what you're saying is accurate but the feds have a different view on they're basically drawing lines in the sand that is really hard to minute that so the acronyms are more about dividing the money up than it is the service because well on the PRTF I mean just from a words and logical standpoint appears to be the same thing as an IMD but it's probably not because of some federal funding rule right so the the PRTFs the psychiatric treatment facilities if they didn't get that designation by the feds to be a PRTF they would probably be considered an IMD or non IMD depending on how many kids were placed with them to be that had that mental health diagnosis so you're right basically to be a PRTF so the feds if you are going to be that IMD they want you to become jump all the way up to be a PRTF. So how do you keep this stuff straight? I was gonna jump in Pat and just say that someone who came in new to mental health world four years ago just made a change here obviously but the IMD designation is really all about an institutional level of really kind of moving away from institutionalization of children's they are trying to say that you have so many beds or a an institutional like setting of people with mental health treatment diagnosis so over 16 is kind of that magic less than 16 number related to IMD Institute of Mental Disease. Thank you sorry for the rabbit hole chairman. No it's a good clarification I mean to your point PRTF is supposed to be higher than QRTP I think with QRPT I've always found it that IMD and I've struggled with I think what you're kind of working through it can seemingly be an arbitrary desert distinction because you could have 17 beds and 13 they could look otherwise the same same level of care one's gonna be an IMD one's not but PRTF is supposed to be there's there's more requirements on it right as far as you know be it the level of staffing and things and the type of staffing you have to have it's a much higher rate to that we're paying as a result of that. Representative Taylor you still there?",FALSE,,
81,"Very good. Representative Voss. I have a comment more than an inquiry I just wanted to compliment you sir on your subject matter expertise the last example that you explained for us was very thorough is from your memory and we've got over 1,200 pages of books to go through and you just astound me with what you know and the expertise that you have and I just wanted to publicly say I appreciate you and thanks for your service to our state this is a massive budget this is a huge spending pool and you are an expert at this and I just wanted to say thank you publicly. Thank you I appreciate it. I wish you could just quit there Pat but we have to continue so there's a whole nother book all right so the next section don't let us down the next section is 43.2 million residential treatment so this is providers that are not considered QRTP or IMD it also funds and so these are like emergency res treatment places placements infant maternity placements so mom with child comes into care those type of placement also funds our specialized care management contract to the tune around 13 million and also funds placements where we're paying the state share of the developmental disabilities over an DMH so you heard I heard them during the testimony they talked about they're coming up with the federal side they had an increase there we place kids over there we're reimbursing the GR side and they draw the federal side in and are serving in them in DMH thank you children's division oh we're not done where we had my goodness now we're all six of eight we can be done if you want okay it's not just DYS see you know you know I don't know is this a movers thing I mean I think previously DYS only have their their own book albeit very small but we're still going with children's division all right very well please proceed all right the next page is page 1072 foster parent training nine hundred seventy six thousand four and forty seven dollars so on foster parents to be licensed they have to go through certain training they have to have ongoing training this help funds the transportation the actual training itself for those parents as they go through the foster parents as they go through the training page 1077 is a foster parent support this is new last year this is 5.4 million dollars so we currently do have some recruitment and resource trainings what we saw before in that section pays for some of it one of the things that got identified is we need to do a better job of recruiting and retaining foster parents so not just on the recruitment side but once you become a foster parent writing that service we were looking at basically bidding out and with a contractual provider to the tune of about three point two seven million dollars for a new RFP the scope of work is just about completed we'll release thatget bidders on this to both recruit and support foster parents throughout their journey. We are adding currently about a million dollars to our existing what they call foster care and recruitment contract and then also 400,000 for what's called ICPC homes throughout the state. But again this just started last year and it's sort of a focus to improve our foster parent numbers. Okay the next section of the foster youth educational assistance 1.7 million dollars, 188,000 GRs, GR 1.5 million federal. What this is is tuition assistance for foster youth for post-secondary education and vocational training. Next section is the foster care case management contracts. These are FCCM, we refer to them as FCCM, but just like we have state staff that manage these cases, these are contracted case managers that are awarded throughout the state through a competitive bid process. We currently have around 4,635 cases placed with the FCCM providers throughout the state. So we've expanded this over recent years I mean how is that experience going in relation to I guess the additional that we're doing? I think it's been going well I think we're looking at you know with the decreasing caseload trying to we are having to kind of move cases around and so not just so much in certain areas because they're kind of being a little bit oversaturated by the contracted providers so we are moving cases between region and region. I think having foster care case managers is a good mix with public and private you know just over the years it's always always kind of helped us out because you know certain things as a state we can do and we can do well but then also you know like we're almost competing against ourselves sometimes where those foster care case managers have a different way to recruit staff and services they can provide in a different manner so I think it's a good mix. I would I would agree with that and we've done a lot of work to really make sure that regardless of where the case management is that your outcome is good right it doesn't matter who you're keeping if you're a youth in care you certainly don't care what company you work for right and so just really making sure that we've worked to the integrity of that to make sure that regardless of where that is that the outcome is good and so it's been a good mix we're about 40 40 it 4,000 and 11 we have 11,000 total so yeah we've come about 40 60 a little less than that. Good yeah glad to hear that's going well so that's very encouraging so you know that was the hope and glad to hear it's you know working as intended and expected thank you. All right next section is the management contract this was one time funding to engage with the management contract when in st. Louis the st. Louis area we were having some difficulties up in that region some of you may require remember around timeliness of our can investigation so we brought in a case management or not case management a management contractor not to be confused with the different section to help get us back on track in the st. Louis areas and I think it's been a success do you want to share some of the numbers? Yeah in November to 21 to October of 22 we had lost about 80% of the workforce in st. Louis so they had significant loss there so they were at about a place of 12 staff to handle 250 hotlines a week which is an unimaginable number if you can imagine being a frontline worker so they had a backlog of around 7,800 and we worked that that got worked down to at one point we got to zero but to 400 so a manageable number of getting that almost completely knocked out and then we've continued to add process improvement levels throughout the process not just the front end but continuing to look at that business process mapping as we go through the process that once you fix one part you have to continue that work on down the line so they've had massive successes they've the average close the average days to close is now down to 15 days and they've kept that backlog down and keeping the victim scene so it's been a huge success for for us and looking at ways to expand that work so this is core reduced and just curious if I mean are you ready to say mission accomplished or do we think that the need will I could continue or where do we feel about where we're at I think we're looking at using some of this and are doing some of this with other core what if you look up in children's admin some existing core funding redistributing it towards some management contracts throughout the state this was one time federal funding that came from that basically for a audit finding we had a couple years back that actually was to our favor so General Assembly we went to the General Assembly at administration then and and that got reinvested in this section so it wasn't necessarily the we wanted the action to be one time but the funding was on time but again once the ship was right and I think we're in good place but we are looking at other places to do this kind of work with great thank you represent Taylor you still like to inquire you may proceed so it sounds like they were successful in fact they may have even been able to come in fairly quickly and pick up your processes and be helpful I'm actually a little surprised that we don't see an NDI if they were that successful working with you why not continue or put them on to the next project I think we're looking at some existing funding in our E&E line to try to help fund that this was a rather significant the next project we would do would be in other regions probably wouldn't be to this scale there was a definite need in the st. Louis area that's probably larger scale than what we could afford within our core house so hence you're thinking that additional projects within your core yeah so if you look at our like our CD admin we do have E&E funding in both CD admin in the CD field section that could help fund this depending you know especially if as our caseload falls that reduces some of our requirements in those other areas all right thank you all right next section is the page 1097 adoption subsidy 116 million 267 thousand 52.6 million GR the request isn't really decreased from the gov's rec just to point out this is part of the F map so you'll show you a new decision item that basically takes it back up to the 117 there was a core reduction on page 1101 to kind of true up this between our GR and federal so the overall when it gets done is going to be 117 I would say previously I'm still not used to this new format underneath their old format I could point you to a page where here's core here's all the changes here's the bottom line you'd see both of them side by side so we're still working on that we'll we'll get there though but this is these are for the adoption payments to parents who adopt kids who come out of our care I think last year the June 2023 or 24 actual there was around 17,000 155 kids receiving an adoptive payment I think as you see our numbers we went from 14,000 down 11,000 you see this grow this will eventually level off as our caseload sort of levels off to the right size where we need it to be whether that be where it is today or 10,000 I don't know what the right is but as we kind of level that off then this will level off but as the foster care goes down this one's going to go up hopefully that's the goal because this is a permanent placement for those kids that come into care next section is similar to adoption subsidy but this is guardianship subsidy this was a program started probably ten years ago so what this is is similar to adoption subs this is a permanent place but these are kinship right so these are grandparents aunts uncles they may not necessarily want to adopt that child just due to some family dynamics or basically you know the age of the child but they do want to take care of that child and have the guardianship this is a supplemental payment to those parents they do get legal guardianship they're off our caseload but it still kind of preserves that family dynamic next section is a kinship navigator this is with the University of Missouri and parent link this $372,000 this is specific to those kinship placements either that are in foster care kind of aligning those with some local services and programs that help meet the physical and emotional needs of those children so it's sort of a placing a need with a provider at the local level all right next section is page 1115 live to give hope this is a one-time fund in FY 2025 at $250,000 federal this again is a funding for community organizational Eclid County provide assistance to at-risk families children and care and families post permanency you next section is on page 1120 it was $55,000 GR and so this was sort of a pilot program to assist kinship care and getting them legal support to help those families maintain that placement and to try to avoid the foster care placement by offering some legal options to some kin to help maybe get guardianship over a child so even before they come to us when then we turn around place them in guardianship head that off up front and have the child placed with the kin before they even come to care a lot of that to do that there are some legal requirements a lawyer back there you could talk more about that but this is kind of a pilot to try to do that the next section is family resource centers and and really if you look at the next four or five next three sectionsthis they're all kind of similar type of programs and so you know if you look at our PD book our program description book around the I can get there there it is 643 it kind of lays out some of these programs but on page 60 44 lays out the total contractor 26.5 million which encompasses this section plus the next two or three sections together. So this is funding for like Foster Adopt Connect, Adoption Resource Center of Eastern, FACC, Adoption Resource Center Central, they've got one in Northeast Hannibal, so these are family resource centers located across the state. So what the goal of this is they work with and provide resources to adoptive parents and kids that are in foster care with you know a goal of the adoption to keep the adoption from disrupting. They provide wraparound services, they also do recruitment for adoptive parents throughout the state, support groups for youth, educational services, so a lot of wraparound services for these kids both in adoption placements and in care to give sort of a local solution to keep these kids safe in that adoption placement. It is GR, a lot of this federal is adoption savings we talked about earlier so we do the change the law previous years we do get increased adoption savings we have to reinvest that in programs that promote and support adoptive placements and so this is a good place to reinvest that. On page 1130 foster care adopt behavioral again this is deliver services in the home to avoid residential pleat treatment placement so even kids in adoptive placement a lot of those do have some of those mental health issues maybe trauma things like that so provide some behavioral health services in it that adoptive home or that foster home in a guardianship home to help keep that child in the home and not entering res treatment. Family Resource Center Wright County on page 1136 this is just a line item for the Family Resource Center in Wright County and again you'll see something similar for Cape Girardeau Adoption Resource Center in Cape Girardeau 500,000 these has been added by the General Assembly over the years so just kind of different sections different locations for these programs. That'll bring us to page 1146 transitional living program 2.6 million dollars you're gonna see this in the next section independent living kind of look hand in hand so the transitional living that's actual placement from these some of these kids that are getting ready to age out of foster care so we're putting them in a placement to help them become independent so they're moving from like a residential treatment to a transitional living scattered site apartments things like that this is the placement cost. The service costs around this around is on page 1152 and that's independent living programs. CHAFEE and it's not an acronym it is the name of John Chafee who the fund is the federal funds are named after but these providers provide independent living skills to youth throughout the states we have providers this is competitively bid across the entire state and so is transitional living we did come and work with this body last year to provide the transitional living providers with a 13% rate increase last year with some additional CHAFEE funds. I don't I think a lot of them you're gonna probably hear from them that wasn't enough it was a competitive bid project competitive bid contract the problem is that competitive bid was years ago before sort of you saw the inflation in housing we are looking at doing an early rebid for transitional living that'll probably happen over the summer into next fall to help them come back and say okay wait a minute we need to rebid this and come up with a new sort of price range for this. Representative Black, inquiry you may proceed. Thank you yeah I think you hit on the issue I was going to discuss Mr. Bluebring but looks like we've got I understand these are maybe difficult placements to make the level of care and the type of service and we've got quite a bit of lapse it looks like on these so transitional living for example looks like on six on 2.6 there was you know nine hundred thousand dollars worth of lapse yep so I guess my question I think you've clearly identified that there's a problem here can we move that revised RFP up to maybe get some of these folks some money a little earlier I think the 13% will eat some of this lap up lapse up in both the transitional independent living sections we are pushing to get that RFP we are pushing staff to get that RFP out as quick as possible anytime we do RFPs with the state of Missouri it just it takes time I wish it weren't the case because I know we hear about this all the time you know this is this is a great need there's a need here can't we just get it done the next four or five months when I talk to procurement staff you know I think they've got so many things that they have to jump through for these programs plus they have a lot of different competing priorities so it's not like this is the only contract they're bidding on chapter 34 is very prescriptive on how we do business and for for good reason because you got to go through a process got to have the legal review you got to have a scope of work it's got to get bid out you've got to have a unbiased evaluation committee and that all takes time and I get why you know and so we do like if we can do single sources things like that use community partnerships to do it faster we do on something like this it's competitive bid it doesn't really fit in the community partnership world there's no way to do a single source so the only way to do it is through a competitive bid I wish there was a way to do single source so the only way to do it is through a competitive bid I wish there was a way to do it faster but I haven't found a way yet yeah I mean and we hear you're not the only department that indicate they have a pretty long lead time on these RFPs and some of us been in public procurement and other settings and these lead times are just awfully awfully long and to me it seems like it gets in the way of state doing its business to serve the people but and I know you may not comment on that initially I mean I I would say it is frustrating for a lot of people including our procurement staff who have to follow all these roles I would say just you know what because when I look at these things always try to look at okay if it's not me in this position you know what I feel safe as a taxpayer to do it I think those chapter 34 protections are just so we can't go out and hey I'm I want to give X amount of money to this provider it's got to go through a certain prescribed prescriptive policy to make sure taxpayer money is being used appropriately oh absolutely that as a safeguard a bit I but it just takes longer to jump through all the hoops and and have four legal reviews and the programmatic review and all the different things yeah I'm a little skeptical of course that it really takes that long but thank you no I I understand yeah I've had this conversation many times yes thank you all right so that's again independent living transitional living program because I am sure you have been hurting hearing from several of the providers as I have next to the child transfer foster care pilot so this was one time funding 616,000 what this is is for phones for foster children and youth we did have some sort of mishaps with this program along the way trying to figure out the right path around this and what the legislative intent we have worked with the representative and some of the sponsors around this I think we have a quick way to access and get a RFP out the door we're also looking at see if there's some community partners that we can provide to send these phones and what this is is provide cell phones to foster care kids who are aging out of the system one of the things that trust me I got kids in college I know is these kids will need cell phones to keep their connections they will need it for schooling everything from there there's a specific program this was kind of designed around that not only will provide them with cell phones there's some security free features on that it enables us to push out alerts and message to kids and maybe keeps that child safer because you know with with human traffic and everything else like that you know that phone is sort of a gateway to some of these kids so we're hopeful to get that out in the next couple months a bit out in order to individual if we can't get it done sooner through a community partnership one of the things that will be faster on this than a full-blown RFP is that there is a qualified vendor list out there so we can go instead of doing the qualified vendor list you can just do what's called a work product request or a WPR that basically says hey we want a B and C it only goes to the four vendors on the statewide list and so it's sort of a abbreviated RFP process so in the RFP process you have to vet every single provider before you even start with the the work request so representative Proudy you have an inquiry on this you may proceed thank you you answer most of it I was looking and saw that we didn't appear that we had gotten started when or have we started with the sort of truncated RFP process I forgot what you called it yeah we're putting together the WPR there was some sort of different approaches trying to originally being approached that I don't think met the intent of the representative spires hearing this okay that was my next question did the line item sort of catch you by surprise like oh we have to do this and no I think there was a couple different thoughts around because it is for cell phones for these kids I think people had different ideals on what they approach and missing that there were some a set technology sort of program that was wanted here and so we will do a WPR anybody that can provide that set type of technology I can do it but I think what we missed wasIt's not just the phone and the provider that we're looking for, it's that technology where we can push out messages to that kid. There's some security features, some tracking features that enable us to help that kid if there would ever be a problem.",TRUE,"I think there was a couple different thoughts around because it is for cell phones for these kids I think people had different ideals on what they approach and missing that there were some a set technology sort of program that was wanted here and so we will do a WPR anybody that can provide that set type of technology I can do it but I think what we missed wasIt's not just the phone and the provider that we're looking for, it's that technology where we can push out messages to that kid.

82,"And just so that I'm kind of clear on what this does, is the representative still a representative here? Did they?",FALSE,,
83,Yes.,FALSE,,
84,"Okay. So Representative Bosley was the sponsor and one of the things that the team helped me identify. So during the past 30 days of kind of the transition was that there was some mixed direction on this in the past. And so we kind of got together and helped to make one of those kind of smarter, not harder decisions of we can do this through a qualified vendor listing and a WPR process rather than a full RFP, which will help it move much quicker. That was about day 20 into day 33 that we made that. So we've started the work there. Sure. And I was just curious because of course, every day we're going to have a child or some children to age out that won't be able to avail themselves of the program. Again, I think that kind of highlights the importance of before we start allocating funds to places that we have some kind of idea of, or have the conversations necessary to make sure that the program functions like we want to. In the meantime, there's over half a million dollars just kind of floating around leaving you all to sort of pick up the pieces on how we allocate that. So I would urge those of us on budget before we started just throwing money all over the budget for the sake of saying that we did something because this is something that had it been done appropriately, kids right now could be benefiting from the half a million dollars appropriation that we put in here. Thank you.",FALSE,,
85,"Yep. And it's more than a cell phone, kind of like that more than a meal. It's assistive technology. So it's actually pushing out messages to help them understand milestones and things that they need to do, and also tracking their progress on that so that we can show those outcomes and help lead to better interventions and form the interventions that we do for foster. I mean, obviously it's a very, very good idea is one that I support, but just execution and doing diligence is always important. Thank you so much for that. Thank you, Mr. Chair. All right, next section is page 1165. These are the child advocacy centers. They're kind of laid out on those advocacy centers on page 660 of the program description book, kind of where they are in our contracted amount, adding up to the 4.368. Now if you look at the 4.368 on our contract and some of these other lists, as you see them, they're not going to add up to our appropriation. That's because our contracts are after the 3% reserve. So you have to take that off.",TRUE,"And it's more than a cell phone, kind of like that more than a meal. It's assistive technology. So it's actually pushing out messages to help them understand milestones and things that they need to do, and also tracking their progress on that so that we can show those outcomes and help lead to better interventions and form the interventions that we do for foster.",
86,"There's a list of those. What they do is provide a setting for children who have been victims of child abuse to be interviewed by a trained forensic interviewer in a child-friendly, neutral, and culturally-centrally area. And so we do have, we had 14. We're down to 13 throughout the state. All right, the next is CAC Prevention Sexual Exploitation on page 1170. This is $500,000 of GR. And again, this is for the CACs to provide prevention, identification, and treatment of child abuse and violence through forensic interviews. Next page is Juvenile IV-E Courts. This is $175,000. This is another one where we can work with the local Juvenile IV-E Court to match things that are IV-E eligible and draw down federal funding to them. It's $175,000. The three courts we work with are Boone County, Jackson County, and the Bruce Normall Juvenile Justice Center in Adair, Knox, and Lewis County. Juvenile Justice Center in Adair, Knox, and Lewis County. The next section is Title IV-E Authority for CASAs. It's $150,000 statewide, a limited amount of funding. The CASAs there to the court-appointed special advocates do have due training that is Title IV-E reimbursable. They get some $75,000, $25,000. So expenditures here are based on expenditures sent to us by CASAs where we can then draw them before e-funding. All right, next section is Child Abuse and Neglect Grant. This is $350,000. There's two grants, the Child Abuse Basic Grant and Children's Justice Act Grant. These are grants to help, basically, we run through to help look at local ideals and projects that can help prevent and reduce child abuse and neglect. There is a task force statewide, the Child Abuse and Prevention Treatment Task Force, that kind of help look and identify grants and grant areas to provide funding to local programs around this. It's $350,000, $309. We do have quite a bit of grant building up here. Some of this was used for a human trafficking program last year. In addition to that, we still, like I said, have had multiple years where we've kind of lapsed some money. We've built up quite a bit of fund balance there those last couple years. So we are looking to expand that authority on page 1191. This is a new decision item for $900,000 to actually do more grants statewide for some local ideals around child abuse and neglect prevention. Representative Lewis, you have an inquiry on this. You may proceed. Obviously, we've already dealt with this a couple times over the last couple years. So what is the fund balance? I do not have it off the top of my head. I can get you both the CAN and the CJA basically carryover amount. But it's north of a couple million? It was. I think the $900,000 is kind of where we're at on what's not obligated, but I'll have to go back and look. It used to be north of $2 million, but that was a couple years ago, I think, when we took some money out to do... Yeah, $800,000 and put it over there. Yeah, and then this $900,000 will lead up a part of that. I'll have to go back and look how much is left after this. And these, the $900,000 that's here can be used for education and training purposes, grants that do the things that are listed there. I mean, this basically, usually, these are educational type things, if I'm not mistaken. Yeah, and I can just read through them, trainings and services, intake assessment, screening, investigations, reports of child abuse and neglect, creating and improving the use of multidisciplinary teams, and improving legal preparation and representation, case management, ongoing case monitoring, enhancing the general child protective system, developing and updating systems technology, developing, strengthening facility training. So a wide range of activities throughout children's division and to the whole provider community. Just a follow-up question, because I think you broke the money that was for, broke out in the budget, the money that was set aside for in your division, the... Was that in book five? Yeah, we hit that a while ago. Yeah, I think, okay, that's good. That's all I just wanted to make sure, because it never really showed up, but I think what you did was you broke it out in the administrative position, and then the other field positions. There's three sections, there's administrative, and then two sections after that on the grants. Perfect, thanks. All right, next section, and I'm going to hit on this a little bit more than I normally would have. And so this is a foster care children's account. It's $8 million. And so there's legislation moving this around around social security and the use of the kids' social security for their care. So this money is not just here, it's also in the foster care and res treatment section. What I will say is, if that bill would pass, we will probably need some sort of language in this section and flexibility between this section and foster care to help implement that bill. So it's not just the authority that bill gives us, but to implement it, we'll have to have some budgetary changes to contract with somebody, some that we can use SSA money for, but some of that we will need to GR for. We have reached out to a provider that's worked with a couple other states. We're going to get their budgetary, kind of what they did in those couple other states. I think one was Arizona. I think we're looking at Kansas and maybe Washington, if I remember off the top of my head. But we're going to try to get what they did in the budget. We can bring that to you and bring you some ideals around. If that legislation were to be implemented, what do we need for next year's budget to actually implement that legislation? Representative Prouty, you have an inquiry, you may proceed. Thank you, Mr.",TRUE,"Yeah, and I can just read through them, trainings and services, intake assessment, screening, investigations, reports of child abuse and neglect, creating and improving the use of multidisciplinary teams, and improving legal preparation and representation, case management, ongoing case monitoring, enhancing the general child protective system, developing and updating systems technology, developing, strengthening facility training.",
87,"Chairman. I'm assuming the bill you're talking about is the one wherein which we allow foster children, instead of taking whatever funds they would get and using it to pay their expenses. I think that was the very first bill we heard on the floor this year. Yep. And I am happy. I think this is something we absolutely need to do. And I obviously can't speak for the committee, but whatever you have, you know, as far as what other states are doing, I'm happy to dig deep into that, because I really want this bill to pass. Yeah. And we can send you what Arizona did. I mean, every state's a little bit different. We have different rules and different financial rules than other states. So we're trying to look at what they did, what can we do internal. But some of this will have to be done external by a contractor, especially when it comes to, like, the kids' account. What we were just talking about, the procurement process, if we're on some of that Social Security money, and so let's say the kids, it's not disability, which would go on an ABLE account, there's an easy way there. But if it's setting our SSA account, you know, we would need somebody outside to manage that account, not just because they can do it better and differently. When that child leaves our custody, you know, basically our relationship, our legal authority ends, we need somebody that maybe can help carry that. That they would take over instead of it just falling off.That's what our goal would be, I don't know what that cost, I don't know what a contract would be, but that's something we hope to put together and bring before this body. I appreciate that, thank you so much, thank you. And with that, that is it for the, with that is that is it for children's division part of this book. We are last to the, the last but not least, the small but the mighty youth services. I believe we got Scott Odom coming up, I hope. Sure you don't want to keep going with that? Okay, good. Scott Odom, Director of Youth Services. While we've fallen short of Representative Lewis's goal for us all, my hope is to both responsibly and quickly conclude our department's testimony. So, DYS provides rehabilitative services and education to youthful offenders committed to the division from the 46 judicial circuits. We have three cores, that's our Youth Services Administration, our Youth Treatment Programs, and our Juvenile Court Diversion. The Governor's recommended budget for fiscal year 2026 is $68.3 million and $1,055 FTE. On page 1,199 is the Youth Administration budget. The Governor's recommended amount is $2.4 million and $39 FTE. The Division of Youth Services Administration provides for funding for our central office, our five regional offices across the state. There were no core changes by the Governor. On page 1,206 is the Youth Treatment budget. The core is $59 million and $996 FTE. The Division of Youth Services Treatment Corps provides funding for all treatment-related and educational services for the youth committed to DYS. DYS currently operates 27 facilities, offering four levels of care. We have three programs considered secure, 15 moderately secure programs, and two community-based. In addition, we provide transitional aftercare services, including the operation of six non-residential day treatment centers. There were no core changes except for the FMAP adjustment. On page 1,216 is a new decision item for an increase of our frontline staff. The request is $1,293,678 and $20 FTE. From FY21 to FY24, DYS has seen a 58% increase in the commitments. We've gone from 363 young people committed annually to 575. To meet the needs of the increased caseload, more staff are needed to fully operate our existing facilities. So we're not talking about building buildings. We're just talking about being able to operate completely the things that are already in operation. With the shortage of existing DYS capacity, youth are remaining in a waiting placement status at contracted local detention centers for a much longer period of time than would otherwise be necessary. These circumstances have created a tremendous strain for the local juvenile courts as well as DYS. On page 1,219 is the juvenile court diversion program. The overall budget is $3.9 million. That includes general revenue and gaming commission funds. This appropriation supports a grant and aid program that provides local juvenile courts with resources to create specific services or solutions for problems unique to their communities. Examples of the projects include after school enrichment programs, youth advocacy projects, and intensive supervision programs. In fiscal year 24, 40 of the 46 judicial circuits participated in JCD programming. And 11,247 youth were reported as having been diverted from deeper entry into the system. This court provides a significant investment in the front end of the juvenile justice system, enabling early and critical interventions at the local level. It works to ensure that far more costly deep end services are avoided. There were no core reductions recommended by the governor. Always heard good things out of the 40th circuit on that item. And I didn't have the heart to stop you. You were going so well, making such good progress. I do have one question on 1208 there on your core youth treatment programs. And it has been a pretty significant lapse over time, even as the appropriation has grown. Is there a decrease? And I'm just curious if that was due primarily to vacancies or what was driving the lapse? Again, it's not as much as it was just going back, say, three years ago. It wasn't as much last year as it was two, three years ago. But what's the cause for the lapse? So, Chairman Deaton, I think our circumstance is that we've made significant progress in resolving our vacancies. We still have some of that remaining. But you do see a steady decrease. And I would say that's in thanks in part to investment that this body's made, along with the governor, for compensation for our folks. So we've been able to hire. We've been able to maintain, reduce vacancies. And so that's what you would see is the corresponding decreasing over time in the lapse. But that is what you attribute the lapse to primarily, is vacancies or not, as the case may be? Yep.",FALSE,,
88,"Okay. Thank you. Anything additional for the Division of Youth Services? Anything additional for the Department of Social Services? Seeing none, thank you for being with us today. Throughout the day, throughout the evening, almost into tomorrow, but not quite. And we do appreciate it. We take very seriously your budget. Obviously, you all serve some of the most vulnerable Missourians. So I hope you take our interest as the compliment that is intended. And committee members, of course, we've got the Office of the State Treasurer tomorrow and the Department of Higher Education Workforce Development at 8.15.
