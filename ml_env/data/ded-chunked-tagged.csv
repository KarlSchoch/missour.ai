1,"So, this is the core budget. This funds everything except Medicaid fraud compliance and our safe kit. Absent any questions, I'll move to page 18. This is an NDI for our Public Protection and Criminal Appeals Division. Last year, we had 473 appeals. We filed 412 briefs, argued more than 100 cases in the Missouri Court of Appeals and the Missouri Supreme Court. As of January 1st, 2025, we've got 1,367 pending appeals. As this body knows, we handle 100% of felony appeals. Cops catch bad guys, prosecutors lock them up, and then we defend those convictions on appeal on behalf of the state. So the volume and workload has increased over time. We have special prosecutors that prosecute across the state of Missouri. They civilly commit sexually violent predators. Most of the cases that we were involved in at the trial court level are child sex cases, sexual assault cases, and murders, so we're putting the worst of the worst away. In 2024, we had cases in 28 different counties across the state, 130 counts, convicted five murders, and this is really about supporting some of our rural prosecutors, many of whom are still part-time. So it's a state resource that we deploy in the fight against violent crime. And leads have increased in those NDI. Moving to page 13, this is our Government Affairs and Litigation and Employment Law section. As this body recalls, we split out our employment law attorneys. Deep analysis revealed that 65% of our civil cases against the state are employment law actions against the state agencies. As those state agencies have grown, as our constitutional amendment has added a state agency, our liability has increased. Those cases have also become more complex in that there are more public interest groups filing more class actions lawsuits against the state today. And so as those operational needs change and grow because of the complexity of litigation grows and the number of cases grows, we need to meet those operational needs. I want to point out that in our civil defense section, a new mentorship program has allowed us to obtain seven complete defense verdicts in employment law actions against the state that saved the state north of $50 million. Additionally, we had 12 cases that we were able to get dismissed before they even got to trial, either a dispositive motion on the pleadings or summary judgment. Again, that's an enormous savings to the public fisc. We've got in governmental affairs right now, we typically run about 1300 cases per year. This year, we've got 1500 cases. So you've seen an increase in growth in those cases. We've also seen a 10 to 15% increase in our caseload in our litigation section. But one win that I want to point out there is our defense of the tort victims compensation fund, where we save the state $124 million by winning that case. Barring questions in our civil section. Moving to tab 16. This is our consumer protection division. As this body will recall, two years ago, I requested a nominal increase in our appropriations authority out of the merchandising practices revolving fund in order to fund six additional FTE that were already on the books in our consumer division that's ramped up our consumer protection work. I would point out also that the nature of consumer protection work has changed over time in the 1990s. What we typically saw were individual entities that were regionally isolated, that were defrauding Missouri consumers. Now we see more complex scams involving electronic means of communication. So again, you see a broader and more complex caseload within our consumer division. This body approved a nominal increase in approvals authority out of the NPRF. My first year in office, first year in office, we recovered 32 million in settlements and judgments on behalf of the state. You funded six additional FTE that were already on the books. Return on the investment this last year was recovered north of $400 million in settlements and judgments on behalf of the state. So proud of the work we're doing in our consumer tech protection division. This is not general revenue. Attorney General, when you give us those numbers, how long does it take the state probably in many cases to actually end up seeing those dollars and are we continuing to go to court and I'm not planning this for my own knowledge. Yeah. Wonder 400 million and it might take us 40 years to get the 400. It might take several years. I would say, you know, two to four years on average and that's an anecdotal estimation. But we we expedite specifically individual recovery for individual Missouri consumer victims. Missouri's first before. Thank you, sir. Barring any other questions, moving to tab 919. This is our labor division. So 10 years. Yeah, I believe it's actually it was in 2014. The General Assembly changed the statute as it relates to disability. So no longer a claim. Can you can claimants make claims for partial permanent disability? Now the only claim is full permanent disability based on seven enumerate statutory enumerated factors. When you change a statute, you wash away a sentiment of case law that interpreted the previous statute. Thus we're doing more appellate work because all of these cases using those seven enumerated factors get appealed and those are cases of first impression. So my labor division is doing more work on the appellate side as the courts interpret the new statute that's now been in place for about 10 years. So we're just trying to catch up with that. Barring any questions on our labor section, moving to tab 22. This is our solicitor office. This is the top appellate attorneys in the state that defend the statutes enacted by the Missouri General Assembly. Barring any questions on solicitor's office. Moving to page 2025. This is the governor's retention schedule for which we are supportive. We have seen and we've seen a symbiotic relationship between recruitment, retention and mentorship. Those have all helped improve our staffing levels. We were hovering at a 25% vacancy rate. When I took over, we've reduced that down to single digits feel like we're pretty close to fully staffed, even though that's a somewhat of a moving target. Retention is the next piece. When I took over, we had a lot of privates and a lot of lieutenants, not a lot of sergeants. In 2022, about 67 attorneys left the office. 2023, we stabilized about 44 attorneys left the office. I'm proud to say last year, we only had 20 attorneys leave the office. And again, that's a direct directly attributable to our ability to recruit talent, and thus manage a better caseload for our attorneys. And then our mentorship program that has resulted in those seven complete defense verdicts. It's an innovative first of its kind in the nation. We're providing better training and mentorship for our attorneys, which is causing them to stay longer and work harder. Thank you.",False,,False,2,,True,4,"This body approved a nominal increase in approvals authority out of the NPRF.

2,"Thank you for bringing this up. Mr. Attorney General, I actually had some questions just a little bit about recruitment and retention. You brought that up in your opening statements. And then as well as we go through these NDIs, we see here often that the need for to fill those current FTS and that's the ask of the salary increase. So help me out in your core right now. We have 340 FTEs, and how many of those positions are currently filled? Right now we have 25 lawyer vacancies. I think we have. In what divisions? That's across all sections in the office. And then I would have to double check the support staff. I believe we have six investigator positions, two paralegals, and about six legal secretary positions. So 25 attorney vacancies, and then in terms of support staff, how many total? I think we have six investigators, two paralegals, and five or six legal secretaries that we're recruiting. Okay.",False,,False,2,,False,5,
3,"And where is this in terms of recent trends? Are you gaining some grounds here? You mentioned how important it is to continue to recruit, but also retain. Yeah, yeah. And you're right. One of the things we've identified is the cyclical nature of hiring attorneys for a government law firm of this size. It's really challenging. As you all know, most of our employees are first-year attorneys that just graduated law school, especially given our pipeline for recruitment out of Mizzou Law with our practicum that we started. The issue there is those students graduate in May, but they don't get their bar results until August. So if I have an attorney that leaves in October of this year, I may not fill the position until August. And so there's always going to be a period of lapse. It's as if a check has been cut, but it hasn't cleared the bank yet, so I'm still showing that money on the bank account. But we feel very positive about the trend lines overall, that our overall consistent vacancy rate has declined in spite of that kind of cyclical nature of our hiring. Okay.",False,,False,2,"The issue there is those students graduate in May, but they don't get their bar results until August. So if I have an attorney that leaves in October of this year, I may not fill the position until August. And so there's always going to be a period of lapse.",False,5,
4,"So increasing salaries. So we're starting beginning attorneys at what now? If these, I guess, if the NDIs are approved? And let me be clear. Our NDIs are not raises for our attorneys. Our NDIs are about filling FTE that are on the books, but are unfunded currently. And again, that's about meeting the operational needs of the office, given the increase in litigation and the increase in the complexity and time involved in that litigation. Okay.",False,,True,4,"Our NDIs are about filling FTE that are on the books, but are unfunded currently.

5,"Then help me out then. In terms of your unexpended funds, you have a tremendous amount of unexpended funds over the last several fiscal years. So what is that attributed to? So we have a lot of unexpended funds, and we're asking for overall several million dollars for your- And unexpended, are you talking about the two million laps in the PS line? Yeah.",False,,False,2,"Then help me out then. In terms of your unexpended funds, you have a tremendous amount of unexpended funds over the last several fiscal years. So what is that attributed to?

6,"Yeah. So again, and that two million laps is directly attributable to the fact that I can't fill a position until, I can't fill most of my positions until August. So like if somebody quits today, there's going to be a period of laps that's going to be reflected on our books at the end of the year regardless. That being said, and I'm sorry, did that answer your question? Yes, more or less, but it, okay, and then help me out just overall. I know we're not quite through all of the divisions. I know we still have Medicaid fraud, a few others. How much of an increase are you asking for overall for your budget? 2.2. Yeah, 2.2 million, sorry.

7,"Okay. Since I'm asking questions now, I'm going to ask my last one. Where are we real quickly on the backlog from Sunshine cases? Certainly, and I have those numbers with me. Let me find that.Oh, yeah, here we go. So overall numbers, we've received 1,000, excuse me, 1,465 Sunshine requests since I've taken office. We have closed 1,390. We have a total of 75 pending from 2024 and 2025. And 40 of those are from 2024, and 35 are as of this year. So we feel confident that we have cleared the backlog. OK, so 75 still pending from 2024. 40 pending from 2024, 75 total. We've received 35 since the first of this year. And you continue to have attorneys dedicated to just that task? Yes, ma'am. OK. What about, so still a pretty significant backlog. In Sunshine law, correct me if I'm wrong, you have how many days to respond? Three business days to either offer the responsive records or provide a time cost estimate of when the records will be made available. OK. And so we still have a pretty significant backlog there. So that's something concerning that honestly didn't exist for a very long time until, I think, 2023 when it really started to expand. So concerned why that still lingers today. The 75?",False,,False,2,"The passage discusses requests and record handling related to Sunshine cases, mentioning terms like 'backlog', 'requests', and 'response times'. However, it does not explicitly mention or refer to 'Information Technology' as a subject matter.",False,5,
8,"Yeah. Well, I will concede that I would rather have zero pending requests and would rather turn them out more rapidly. But the problem is the complexity of the records we have to review because so many of them are legal files. And so a request may trigger a response of 50,000 documents that we have to go through line by line to ensure we're not breaching attorney-client privilege. And so it's more difficult for a law firm to respond to Sunshine requests than, say, an entity that doesn't have a basis for closure, isn't morally and legally responsible for protecting that kind of confidential information. OK.",False,,True,4,"And so a request may trigger a response of 50,000 documents that we have to go through line by line to ensure we're not breaching attorney-client privilege.",False,5,

10,"Yeah. And this is our Medicaid Fraud Compliance Unit. This is our unit that protects stewards of state resources and makes sure our most vulnerable have access to state health care. Pending any questions, going to 36. This is our NDI for our Medicaid Fraud Compliance Unit. We're asking for one additional investigator. This is a 75-25 Fed match. But we believe that we can increase our investigations and, again, continue to protect our most vulnerable in the taxpayer dollars with that additional investigator. Moving on to 39.

11,"Thank you. I'm just curious on the Medicaid part. With the federal government doing what they're doing, do they prosecute cases here? Where does the responsibilities break down? It's a great question, Senator. There's multiple lines of jurisdiction that overlap. And so we prosecute a lot of cases that could be federal cases. But we take it on because we want to recover the money on behalf of the state of Missouri and protect Missourians. And at the end of the day, the federal government has supported resources for our office to be able to do that. The federal government certainly could prosecute their own cases.

15,"Mr. Moore, whenever you're ready. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. Good morning, Senator, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. I'm Daryl Moore, Missouri Office of Prosecution Services. This should be fairly quick. In terms of the core budget on page two, our core budget is actually $48,747 less than last year. That's only because I had to transfer money from House Bill 12 that funds my office to House Bill 13 to cover additional rent for space that we have added in terms of training and meeting space. So that's with the facilities management. But otherwise, the core is the same. On page 10 is the new decision item. Brief history, I know Senator Williams will be familiar with it. In 2023, members of the General Assembly, both parties, approached my office with the idea of setting up a statewide conviction review unit since only the large offices, St. Louis City, St. Louis County, Jackson County, could have them. And most of the other offices are too small to do it. I was approached toward the end of that session by Cody Smith and the Budget Committee offering to give me money. I shouldn't say give. That sounds bad. Doesn't appropriate money. Well, it sounds counterintuitive to the experience I've had with the former chairman of the house. Well, and I would say to you, Mr. Chairman, I was surprised when I was approached and offered an appropriation to set up the office. I declined for two reasons, which makes my state representative, Darren Chappell, happy. The primary reason was I had no statutory authority to set up such a thing, and I wasn't going to go venturing out on my own to do it. And number two, I hadn't looked at it, so I had no idea what staff we would actually need. So in 2024, I know with the help of Senator Williams and the Senate and other folks, we had legislation passed setting up the conviction review unit. Unfortunately, there was no appropriation to actually set it up. So that's why this new decision item is this year. I know that the governor did not recommend it, but I would say to you, I can't set it up if I have not appropriated funds to set it up. I know GR is tight, as I testified in front of House Budget yesterday. If I could even receive funding for one attorney and the investigator, it would at least give us a beginning to see what the actual need would be for the office. And whoever succeeds me next year can come back and ask you for more money, if they need the money. But this is a worthy unit. We need it. We've already had inquiries about it, so I would respectfully ask that you all consider at least funding the one attorney and one investigator. On page 13, Mr. Chair. Yeah, give us just a second. Senator Williams. Yeah, thank you for raising that issue. And just for the committee's sake, we do have new members on the committee this year. The Conviction Review Unit would basically allow prosecutors to determine innocence for those that may have been potentially wrongfully convicted of a crime. We've seen in other offices that do have this unit, it has been very successful, to the extent that a gentleman by the name of Lamar Johnson was able to be freed due to a crime he did not commit and was able to walk his daughter down the aisle for her wedding. So we've seen some very positive stories that have come from this. And these are people that have served 20, 30, 40 years of their life just to be determined that they were innocent. So we were very proud to work on that, and I hope that the committee understands that putting some money towards this could be very helpful to our state, especially addressing crimes or situations of this issue where those may have been wrongfully convicted. Again, going back to page 13, the new decision item, this is simply for E&E. I only have two positions funded out of general revenue. The rest are grant funds or other funds. Courts are charged. The general revenue fund funds my domestic violence, sexual offense, special prosecutor that goes around the state helping train prosecutors and actually helping try cases, and also our child abuse resource prosecutor. This is the first time in the seven years that I've appeared in front of this committee that I've asked for any increase in E&E. But travel expenses for those two positions has just increased over the last three or four years, and I see that the governor did recommend that. So I'd respectfully ask for that $7,000. And then finally, of course, on page 15 is the governor's pay plan, which we support. Thank you, Mr. Moore. Any questions from the committee for the prosecutor? Seeing none, appreciate it. Next up, we got the Department of Economic Development. Michelle Hadaway, whenever you're ready. Good morning, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. I'm Michelle Hadaway, director for the Missouri Department of Economic Development. The department is focused on providing businesses the resources they need in order to achieve success, build sustainable growth, strengthening our state's communities, and promoting Missouri as an ideal place to visit, help develop a talented andskilled workforce and maintaining a high quality of life for our fellow Missourians. My team is here to answer any questions that you guys have. For the sake of time and be respectful of your time, today I'll be going over any ongoing core changes and NDIs, and then all the one times from fiscal year 25 have been reduced. I won't be touching those unless you'd like me to go into more detail. Okay, so if you turn to page two and seven, this is the governor's play pan, I won't go into too much detail, you guys have heard about that. If you turn to page 10, this is a regional engagement, core reduction of WIOA funded PS, E&E, and FTE tied to the NDI on page 18 for $355,000 fund switch from federal dollars to GR. Five FTE, these five FTE are currently unfunded and they will be positions that will fill in Kansas City, St. Louis, Central, North, and Southwest Missouri. If you turn to page 45, the NDI is not recommended by the governor, so let's turn to page 84, this is an NDI for CHIP semiconductor, restoring funding as ongoing instead of one time. If you turn to page 113, this is a core reduction for the Community Development Block Grant or CDBG, these are federal dollars of over $11 million in excess authority that already has been expended. You turn to page 129 and 136, this is an NDI for the Missouri Main Street transfer, last year it was put in as one time, this is a request as an ongoing transfer request and then the NDI to coincide with it. You turn to page 176, this is a core reduction for the Missouri Community Service Commission or MCSE, these are ARPA grants that are now closed and the remaining funds have been transferred to the formula funding and the normal MCSE budget. Turn to page 209, this is Missouri One Start, it's a core reduction over $2 million in excess spend authority. If you turn to page 224 and 231, these NDIs are regarding upskill but they were not recommended by the Governor, so we'll continue on. To page 241, this NDI was not recommended by the Governor, we have questions? Okay. Page 244, this is a statewide planning grant, this was reduced to zero as we are expending those funds and the grant is currently closing out. Turn to page 262, National Security Crossroads, again we've expended the funds and the grant's closing out. Page 277, NDI for tourism, this is a DR transfer increase, the Governor recommended an increase of a DR transfer of $1 million to coincide with the NDI on page 287 for event sponsorship. Page 305, this is an NDI Governor recommended an increase of $500,000 to the Route 66 Commission and then turn to page 301, this is an NDI for $3 million for the FIFA World Cup for marketing and or sponsorship. And page 325, this is the Emergency Solutions Grant Program, core reduction to zero as all funds have been paid out from HUD to the Missouri Housing Development Commission.
